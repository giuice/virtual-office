[CRITICAL_REMINDER]
- **CRITICAL:** Components exceeding 300-400 lines significantly hinder AI processing. Aggressively decompose large components into smaller, single-responsibility units using SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns principles. Prioritize this during refactoring and new component creation.

- Ensured correct Date object assignment in MessagingContext to avoid TypeScript errors.
- Updated simple socket server to acknowledge replyToId for basic threading support.
- Implemented Socket.IO listeners and emitters for real-time reaction updates in both backend (`socket-server.js`) and frontend (`MessagingContext.tsx`). Ensured `replyToId` is broadcast.
- Refactored user invitation to use token-based flow, fixing ID mismatch. Added DB functions, API endpoints, and frontend page/component updates.
- Regularly running `analyze-project` after significant code changes keeps the dependency trackers (`module_relationship_tracker.md`, mini-trackers) accurate and prevents potential issues during development.
- Adding console logs to relevant frontend and backend components is a useful technique for tracing the execution flow during manual testing, especially for multi-step processes like user invitations.
- Pages within `src/pages` (Pages Router) are not automatically wrapped by providers defined in `src/app/layout.tsx` (App Router). Context-dependent pages in `src/pages` need their own provider wrapping if `src/pages/_app.tsx` is not used.
- Identified that `src/lib/messaging-api.ts` is missing several functions needed by the messaging hooks (reactions, status updates, typing indicators, archiving, read status). These need to be implemented along with corresponding backend API routes.
- Corrected import paths and type definitions in messaging hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`, `useSocketEvents`) to resolve build errors after fixing floor plan import.
- Adding placeholder client-side API functions first helps structure the frontend logic before implementing the corresponding backend routes.
- Creating placeholder backend route handlers with TODOs helps structure the backend implementation and identify necessary database functions early.
- Refactoring large utility files (like dynamo.ts) into smaller, entity-specific modules improves code organization and maintainability (SOLID). Using a barrel file (index.ts) ensures backward compatibility.
- Updating type definitions (`src/types/database.ts`) is crucial when adding new fields to data models to avoid TypeScript errors during implementation.
- Using atomic `UpdateExpression` in DynamoDB (e.g., for reactions, unread counts) is safer than get-modify-put operations to avoid race conditions.
- TypeScript null checks (`if (!var)`) might not always satisfy the compiler in later scopes; non-null assertion (`var!`) can be used if nullness is guaranteed by prior logic.
- Using `apply_diff` is more reliable than `search_and_replace` when the exact content might have subtle variations or when replacing multi-line blocks.
- Remember to update shared constants (like `TABLES` in `utils.ts`) when adding new entities or features that rely on them.
- Integrating newly created DB functions into API routes requires careful updating of import paths and function arguments.
- Refactoring duplicated code (like generic DB helpers) into a central location (`operations.ts`) improves maintainability and reduces redundancy. Need to update imports in all consuming files.
- Running `analyze-project` after significant refactoring (like moving shared functions) is crucial for keeping dependency trackers accurate.
- **Project Pivot (3/31):** Switched focus from DynamoDB to Supabase due to cost concerns. Paused DynamoDB feature work and initiated planning for Supabase migration.
- Status check complete (3/31). Transitioned to Strategy phase for Supabase migration planning.
- **Repository Pattern Pivot (3/31):** Adopted Repository Pattern during Strategy phase for Supabase migration to improve data access abstraction and maintainability. Updated instruction files accordingly.
- Refactoring API routes requires careful checking of repository interface capabilities. If a required method (like `findByUserId`) is missing, the refactoring for that specific route must be deferred until the interface and implementation are updated.
- Transitioned to Execution phase (3/31) to begin Supabase migration implementation.
- Corrected execution path (3/31) to follow Repository Pattern migration plan, starting with interface definitions.
- Defined all repository interfaces (IUserRepository, ICompanyRepository, etc.) in `src/repositories/interfaces/` (3/31).
- Implemented all Supabase repository classes (SupabaseUserRepository, etc.) in `src/repositories/implementations/supabase/` (3/31).
- Refactoring API routes involves replacing direct DB calls with repository method calls, updating imports, adjusting data handling/types, and ensuring error handling remains appropriate. Sometimes type definitions or repository interfaces need adjustments discovered during implementation (e.g., `Space.userIds`, filtering logic).
- When refactoring API routes, carefully check the *specific logic* of the route. A simple repository method (like `findByUserId`) might not be sufficient if the route needs to find *all* related items (requiring `findAllByUserId`).
- **Type Consistency:** When refactoring API routes to use repositories, ensure the data types used in the route (e.g., for request body parsing, preparing data for the repository) match the types expected by the repository interface methods (e.g., `Message` from `@/types/messaging` vs. `@/types/database`). Mismatches can cause subtle TypeScript errors.
- Repository method return types must match the expected usage in the API route. If a method like `findByConversation` returns `Message[]` but the route expects `PaginatedResult<Message>`, the route needs temporary adjustments until the repository method is updated.
- If strict type checking causes persistent issues with object indexing (e.g., `Element implicitly has an 'any' type`), and the underlying type definition cannot be immediately fixed, using a type assertion (`as any`) can be a temporary workaround to proceed, but the type definition should be revisited later.
- Prioritize refactoring/implementing prerequisite features (e.g., Space/Room management APIs) before attempting end-to-end testing of dependent features (e.g., messaging within rooms).
- Placing hooks (`useX`) in `src/hooks` is standard convention and avoids confusion compared to placing them within `src/contexts`.
- Duplicate files (like `MessagingContext.tsx`) can cause significant issues; verify imports (`layout.tsx`, components) to ensure the correct version is used before deleting duplicates.
- Ensure type definitions are consistent across files (`src/types/` vs `src/contexts/x/types.ts`) and remove unused/undefined type imports.
