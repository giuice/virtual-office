## 2025-03-07: Firebase to DynamoDB Migration (Epic 2)

### Added
- AWS DynamoDB integration as a replacement for Firebase Firestore
- Server-side API routes for all database operations
- DynamoDB table setup script and testing utilities
- Comprehensive database documentation

### Key Components Added
- `/src/lib/dynamo.ts`: Core DynamoDB operations with server-side validation
- `/src/lib/aws-config.ts`: AWS SDK configuration with environment handling
- `/src/lib/api.ts`: Client-side API functions for interacting with server endpoints
- `/src/pages/api/*`: Server-side endpoints for all database operations
- `/docs/database.md`: Complete documentation of database schema and usage

### Fixed
- Issue with `getUsersByCompany` - Added proper GSI index querying
- Issue with `updateUserStatus` - Improved update expressions with attribute naming
- Compatibility between Firebase Timestamp and DynamoDB date formats
- Error handling in DynamoDB queries and updates

### Technical Details
- Implemented Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) for efficient querying:
  - CompanyIndex for company-based queries
  - RoomIndex for room-based queries
- Added date/timestamp conversion utility for Firebase/DynamoDB compatibility
- Enhanced type safety with TimeStampType union type
- Implemented proper expression attribute names for reserved keywords
- Added detailed error logging for database operations

### What We Did
We successfully migrated from Firebase Firestore to AWS DynamoDB by:

1. Creating six DynamoDB tables with appropriate indexes:
   - virtual-office-companies
   - virtual-office-users
   - virtual-office-rooms
   - virtual-office-messages
   - virtual-office-announcements
   - virtual-office-meeting-notes

2. Implementing a server-side API architecture to ensure:
   - AWS credentials remain secure (server-side only)
   - DynamoDB operations happen only on the server
   - Client-side code uses fetch API to interact with endpoints

3. Enhancing DynamoDB implementation with:
   - Proper GSI querying mechanisms
   - Robust error handling
   - Timestamp conversion between formats
   - Attribute expression handling for reserved words

### Next Steps
1. Complete the integration testing of all DynamoDB operations
2. Improve error handling with more specific error types
3. Implement DynamoDB Streams for real-time notifications
4. Add caching layer for frequent DynamoDB queries

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Duplicate Company Creation Issue (Bugfix)

### Fixed
- Critical issue with duplicate company creation in DynamoDB
- Protected route logic causing redirection loops
- Company creation flow allowing multiple companies per user

### Added
- Company cleanup functionality to remove duplicate entries
- Admin tools for database maintenance
- Safeguards against future duplicate creation
- Improved error handling in company-related operations

### Key Components Fixed
- `/src/hooks/useProtectedRoute.ts`: Updated to check for `currentUserProfile?.companyId` instead of just `company`
- `/src/contexts/CompanyContext.tsx`: Added check for existing companies before creating new ones
- `/src/app/(auth)/create-company/page.tsx`: Added validation to prevent access if user already has a company
- `/src/lib/api.ts`: Implemented `cleanupDuplicateCompanies()` function for database cleanup

### New Components
- `/src/pages/api/companies/cleanup.ts`: Server-side API endpoint for removing duplicate companies
- `/src/app/tools/cleanup-companies/page.tsx`: Web interface for manual company cleanup

### Technical Details
- Enhanced route protection with proper company association checks
- Added database integrity checks before company creation
- Implemented cleanup functionality that preserves most recent company entry
- Fixed AWS DynamoDB configuration issues affecting company operations
- Improved user profile updates to correctly associate with company ID

### What We Did
We fixed a critical issue causing duplicate company creation by:

1. Correcting the route protection logic in `useProtectedRoute.ts`:
   - Now checking `currentUserProfile?.companyId` instead of just `company`
   - Preventing unnecessary redirects to company creation

2. Enhancing company creation flow in `CompanyContext.tsx`:
   - Adding checks for existing companies before creating new ones
   - Improving user profile updates with proper companyId association

3. Adding database cleanup functionality:
   - Creating `/api/companies/cleanup.ts` API endpoint for removing duplicates
   - Implementing `cleanupDuplicateCompanies()` function in `api.ts`
   - Adding cleanup call during user login to fix existing issues

4. Fixing redirection in `create-company/page.tsx`:
   - Adding validation to prevent access if user already has a company
   - Changing redirect path to dashboard after successful creation

5. Creating an admin cleanup tool at `/tools/cleanup-companies/page.tsx`:
   - Building a web interface to manually clean up duplicate companies
   - Implementing logic to keep the most recent company and remove others

### Next Steps
1. Add database integrity constraints to prevent future duplicate issues
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for company operations
3. Add database monitoring for detecting abnormal patterns
4. Enhance user feedback during company-related operations
