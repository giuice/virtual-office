# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Virtual Office application has suffered from recent AI-driven changes that have broken critical functionality and created numerous duplicate files. The avatar system no longer works properly, the invitation system is broken, and there are multiple files performing the same functions scattered throughout the codebase. This has created a maintenance nightmare and prevents proper development progress. We need a comprehensive system audit to map the current state, identify what's broken vs working, eliminate duplicates, and establish clear documentation to prevent future AI-generated code duplication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of the current file structure and functionality, so that I can understand what exists, what's broken, and what needs to be cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the system audit THEN the system SHALL document all files in critical directories (src/components, src/lib, src/hooks, src/repositories)
2. WHEN analyzing functionality THEN the system SHALL identify which features are working vs broken
3. WHEN examining files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate implementations of the same functionality
4. WHEN reviewing recent changes THEN the system SHALL analyze git history to understand what broke and when
5. IF multiple files serve the same purpose THEN the system SHALL document which version is the canonical implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate files and consolidate functionality, so that there's only one source of truth for each feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate files are identified THEN the system SHALL determine which implementation is most complete and correct
2. WHEN consolidating functionality THEN the system SHALL preserve all working features from duplicate implementations
3. WHEN removing duplicate files THEN the system SHALL update all imports and references to point to the canonical version
4. WHEN merging implementations THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is lost in the process
5. IF there are conflicting implementations THEN the system SHALL choose the one that follows project patterns and works correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the current system architecture and file organization, so that future AI assistants understand what exists and don't create duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the system THEN the documentation SHALL include the purpose and location of every major component
2. WHEN describing functionality THEN the documentation SHALL specify which files handle which responsibilities
3. WHEN outlining patterns THEN the documentation SHALL explain the project's architectural decisions and conventions
4. WHEN providing examples THEN the documentation SHALL show how to extend existing functionality rather than recreate it
5. IF new functionality is needed THEN the documentation SHALL guide developers to the correct location and pattern to follow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restore broken avatar functionality, so that user profile pictures display correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users have uploaded avatars THEN the system SHALL display them correctly in all components
2. WHEN users sign up with Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL automatically use their Google profile picture
3. WHEN avatar URLs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessible and properly formatted
4. WHEN avatar loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks and error handling
5. IF avatar components exist in multiple locations THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, reusable implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restore broken invitation functionality, so that company admins can invite new team members successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admins generate invitations THEN the system SHALL create valid, accessible invitation links
2. WHEN users click invitation links THEN the system SHALL guide them through proper signup and company assignment
3. WHEN invitations are processed THEN the system SHALL properly integrate with the authentication system
4. WHEN invitation status changes THEN the system SHALL update the database and UI accordingly
5. IF invitation components are duplicated THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into working implementations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want established coding guidelines and patterns documented in the specs, so that future development follows consistent approaches and avoids duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new functionality THEN developers SHALL check existing implementations before creating new files
2. WHEN extending features THEN developers SHALL modify existing files rather than creating duplicates
3. WHEN following patterns THEN developers SHALL use the established architectural conventions documented in the specs
4. WHEN creating components THEN developers SHALL follow the documented component organization and naming conventions
5. IF uncertainty exists about implementation approach THEN developers SHALL refer to the documented patterns and examples in the specs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, organized codebase with clear separation of concerns, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each file SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN looking for functionality THEN there SHALL be only one canonical implementation of each feature
3. WHEN following imports THEN all references SHALL point to the correct, working implementations
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the file structure SHALL guide developers to the appropriate location
5. IF similar functionality exists THEN it SHALL be properly organized and deduplicated
