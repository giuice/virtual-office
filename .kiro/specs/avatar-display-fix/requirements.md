# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issue where user avatars are not displaying properly in the Virtual Office application despite being successfully uploaded and stored in Supabase storage. Additionally, when users sign up with Google authentication, the system should automatically use their Google profile avatar as the default avatar. Users expect to see their profile pictures throughout the application interface, but currently only fallback initials are shown. This impacts user experience and the visual identity features of the virtual office platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded avatar image to display consistently across all parts of the application, so that my visual identity is properly represented in the virtual office.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image in the dashboard header within 5 seconds
2. WHEN a user uploads a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image in the floor plan view immediately after upload
3. WHEN a user uploads a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image in all messaging components consistently
4. WHEN a user uploads a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image in user profile sections without requiring page refresh
5. IF an avatar image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback initials with consistent styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want avatar images to load reliably and quickly, so that I don't experience broken images or long loading times in the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an avatar image is requested THEN the system SHALL load the image within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN an avatar image fails to load THEN the system SHALL automatically retry loading once before showing fallback
3. WHEN an avatar URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL log the error and display fallback initials
4. WHEN a user updates their avatar THEN the system SHALL invalidate any cached versions and display the new image immediately
5. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL show a loading state for up to 10 seconds before falling back to initials

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities for avatar loading, so that I can quickly identify and resolve avatar display issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an avatar fails to load THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including URL, error type, and user context
2. WHEN avatar components render THEN the system SHALL provide debug information in development mode
3. WHEN avatar URLs are constructed THEN the system SHALL validate URL format and accessibility
4. WHEN Supabase storage URLs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper public access permissions
5. IF avatar loading errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my avatar changes to be immediately visible without requiring browser refresh, so that I can see updates in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a new avatar THEN the system SHALL update all avatar displays within the current session immediately
2. WHEN a user removes their avatar THEN the system SHALL revert to fallback initials across all components immediately
3. WHEN avatar data changes in the database THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all active UI components
4. WHEN multiple avatar components exist on the same page THEN the system SHALL update all instances consistently
5. IF cache invalidation is required THEN the system SHALL implement cache-busting techniques to ensure fresh image loading

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who signs up with Google authentication, I want my Google profile picture to be automatically used as my default avatar, so that I have a personalized experience from the start without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up using Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL automatically retrieve their Google profile picture URL
2. WHEN a user's Google profile picture is retrieved THEN the system SHALL store it as their default avatar in the user profile
3. WHEN a user with a Google avatar logs in THEN the system SHALL display their Google profile picture across all avatar components
4. WHEN a user updates their Google profile picture THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to refresh their avatar from Google
5. IF a Google profile picture is unavailable or fails to load THEN the system SHALL fall back to the standard initial-based avatar
6. WHEN a user with a Google avatar uploads a custom avatar THEN the system SHALL prioritize the custom upload over the Google profile picture
