**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the project.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans.
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state.
```
## Current Work Focus:
- **Execute Supabase Migration (Phase 3: Frontend Integration & Testing):** Integrating frontend components with refactored APIs and testing functionality.
    - **Messaging Integration:** Completed initial integration of `MessagingContext` and related hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`, `useSocketEvents`) with refactored Supabase API endpoints via `messagingApi`. Resolved structural issues (duplicate context, hook locations).

## Next Steps:

1.  **Test Messaging Functionality:** Perform end-to-end testing of core messaging features:
    *   Sending/receiving messages in rooms/DMs.
    *   Fetching message history.
    *   Fetching/creating conversations.
    *   Adding/removing reactions.
    *   Archiving/unarchiving conversations.
    *   Marking conversations as read.
    *   Typing indicators.
2.  **Address TODOs:** Review and address TODO comments within the messaging hooks and API client (e.g., error handling, unimplemented attachment uploads).
3.  **(Prerequisite Check):** Ensure Supabase project is created and schema applied (still relevant).

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- **Data Migration:** Confirmed decision: No data migration needed; start fresh.
- **Repository Pattern:** Adopted for data access abstraction. Interfaces and Supabase implementations complete. API routes refactored. Frontend integration in progress.
- **Real-time:** Continue using existing Socket.IO implementation (`socket-server.js`, hooks). Supabase Realtime integration is on hold.
- **Dependency Injection:** Currently using manual instantiation of repositories in API routes; consider a more formal DI approach later if complexity increases.
- **Message Drafts:** Feature temporarily removed due to missing type definition. Revisit later if needed.
