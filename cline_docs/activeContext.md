## System Configuration
- **Project Structure:** 
  - Key directories identified in dependency_tracker.md:
    - src/app: Application pages and routing
    - src/components: UI components including floor-plan, search, and UI elements
    - src/contexts: React contexts for state management
    - src/hooks: Custom React hooks
    - src/lib: Utility functions and API interfaces
    - src/pages: Additional page components

## Development Progress
- **Messaging System Implementation (in progress):**
  - Created initial API endpoints for message and conversation management.
  - Added UI component enhancements for chat functionality.
  - Implemented mock database structure for messages and conversations.
  - **Set up basic real-time infrastructure using Socket.IO:**
    - Created client-side context (`MessagingContext`).
    - Created and started a standalone development Socket.IO server (`socket-server.js`).
    - Integrated context provider into the application layout.
    - Added a test component to the dashboard for verification.

- **Room Management Features (completed):**
  - Room creation with template selection
  - Room editing with form validation
  - Room deletion and duplication
  - Room filtering and search
  - Room property management (type, status, capacity, features)
  - Room access control and reservation system
  - Componentization following SOLID principles

- **Interactive Floor Plan (completed):**
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for room positioning
  - Zooming and panning capabilities for better navigation
  - Grid snapping for precise room placement
  - Visual feedback for user interactions (hover, selection)
  - Room resizing with corner handles
  - Theme-aware styling for consistent visual appearance

- Other improvements:
  - Navigation with responsive design
  - Theme toggle updated with current theme display
  - AWS configuration implemented
  - Search functionality optimized with debounced search
  - Error handling improved with ErrorBoundary component
  - Documentation updated in strategy_tasks directory

## Current Priorities
1. Continue implementing Messaging System:
   - Implement real-time messaging with Socket.io
   - Create UI components for messaging system
   - Integrate messaging with user profiles
   - Implement message threading and reactions

2. Continue implementing features from the Strategy phase:
   - Global Blackboard/Announcements
   - User Profile Management
   - Notification System

## Next Steps
1. **Continue Messaging System implementation (current priority):**
   - Verify Socket.IO connection using the test component on the dashboard.
   - Implement actual message state updates in `MessagingContext`.
   - Develop UI components for message feed and direct messaging (Step 3 & 4).
   - Integrate messaging with user profiles.
   - Implement message threading and reactions.
2. Test the Room Management implementation with real users.
3. Update task_list.md to reflect completed tasks.
4. Continue with the implementation of remaining features in the prioritized order.
