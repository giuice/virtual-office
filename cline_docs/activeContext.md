## Recent Changes
- **Messaging System Implementation:**
  - *ChatWindow.tsx*: Added state (`replyingToMessage`) and handlers (`handleStartReply`, `handleCancelReply`) for managing reply context. Passed necessary props down to `MessageList` and `MessageInput`.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added `onStartReply` prop, reply button, and visual indicator for replied messages.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageInput.tsx*: Modified props to accept `replyingToMessage` and `onCancelReply`. Added UI to display reply context and cancel button. Updated `handleSend` to pass `replyToId`. Fixed `useRef` import.
  - *src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts*: Implemented database logic using `getDocument` and `updateDocument` to add/remove reactions in DynamoDB. (Authentication still uses placeholder).
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `fetch` call within `addReaction` to send data to the `/api/messages/react` endpoint.
  - Created placeholder API route `src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts` for handling reactions.
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `addReaction` function (with optimistic update logic) and exposed it via context.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Connected `handleSelectReaction` to call the context's `addReaction` function.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added reaction selection popover UI. Imported Popover components, wrapped reaction button in trigger, added PopoverContent with emoji buttons connected to placeholder `handleSelectReaction` function.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added initial UI for message reactions (button appears on hover, calls placeholder function).
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Updated to use `companyUsers` from `CompanyContext` to display the correct sender name and avatar for messages, replacing the placeholder logic.
  - *src/components/floor-plan/floor-plan.tsx*: Modified `onSpaceDoubleClick` handler to trigger `handleOpenChat`, integrating the room chat panel with floor plan double-click interaction.
  - Added initial API endpoints for messaging functionality:
    - *src/app/api/messages/create/route.ts*: Created endpoint for sending new messages
    - *src/app/api/messages/get/route.ts*: Created endpoint for retrieving messages with pagination
    - *src/app/api/conversations/create/route.ts*: Created endpoint for creating new conversations
    - *src/app/api/conversations/get/route.ts*: Created endpoint for retrieving conversations with filtering
  - Enhanced FloorPlanCanvas.tsx with onSpaceDoubleClick event for chat integration
  - Updated room-management.tsx to support opening chat for specific rooms
  - Added uuid dependency for generating unique IDs for messages and conversations
  - Installed `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` dependencies.
  - Created `src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx` with basic Socket.IO client setup.
  - Created `socket-server.js` for standalone Socket.IO server during development.
  - Integrated `MessagingProvider` into `src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Added temporary test component to `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`.
  - **Verified Socket.IO connection** using the test component and confirmed basic message state update logic in `MessagingContext`.
  - **Created initial UI component structure** for messaging in `src/components/messaging/`:
    - `ChatWindow.tsx`: Container for displaying conversations.
    - `MessageList.tsx`: Component to render lists of messages.
    - `MessageInput.tsx`: Component for composing and sending messages.
    - `RoomMessaging.tsx`: Wrapper for room-specific chat panels. Integrated with `MessagingContext`.
    - `ConversationList.tsx`: Placeholder for listing direct message conversations.
  - **Integrated UI with Context:**
    - *src/components/messaging/RoomMessaging.tsx*: Connected to `MessagingContext` to filter messages by `roomId` and use `sendMessage`.
    - *src/components/floor-plan/message-dialog.tsx*: Refactored to use `ChatWindow` and connect to `MessagingContext` for direct messages, generating a `conversationId`. Fixed type error related to user IDs.
- **Dependency Tracker Maintenance:**
  - Updated `doc_tracker.md` and `dependency_tracker.md`, resolving most placeholders. Two placeholders remain in `doc_tracker.md` due to tool limitations with index calculation.
- **Dashboard Layout Improvement:**
  - *src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx*: Refactored layout to prioritize `CompanyOverviewCard` and `QuickLinksGrid`. Removed the large static floor plan link card and the temporary messaging test component.

    - Integrated context provider into the application layout.
    - Added a test component to the dashboard.
    - **Verified connection and basic state update:** Confirmed client connects to the server, sends messages, and the `MessagingContext` updates its `messages` state upon receiving `receive_message` events.
    - **Created messaging UI component placeholders:** Added `ChatWindow`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`, `RoomMessaging`, and `ConversationList` in `src/components/messaging/`.
    - **Integrated messaging UI with context:** Connected `RoomMessaging` and `MessageDialog` to `MessagingContext` for basic functionality.
    - **Integrated room chat with floor plan double-click:** Modified `floor-plan.tsx` to open the `RoomChatIntegration` panel when a room is double-clicked.
    - **Integrated user profiles with message display:** Updated `MessageList.tsx` to show sender name/avatar using `CompanyContext`.
    - **Implemented message reactions:**
        - Added UI (button + popover) in `MessageList.tsx`.
        - Connected UI to context (`addReaction`) for optimistic updates.
        - Created API endpoint (`/api/messages/react`) with DB logic (using `getDocument`/`updateDocument`).
        - Connected context `addReaction` to call the API endpoint.
    - **Implemented initial message threading UI & State:**
        - Added reply button and visual indicator in `MessageList.tsx`.
        - Updated `MessageInput.tsx` to display reply context and pass `replyToId`.
        - Added state management for `replyingToMessage` in `ChatWindow.tsx`.
- **Dependency Trackers Updated:** Performed maintenance, resolving most placeholders.

  - Room access control and reservation system
  - Componentization following SOLID principles

- **Interactive Floor Plan (completed):**
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for room positioning
  - Zooming and panning capabilities for better navigation
  - Grid snapping for precise room placement
  - Visual feedback for user interactions (hover, selection)
  - Room resizing with corner handles
  - Theme-aware styling for consistent visual appearance

- Other improvements:

## Current Priorities
1. Continue implementing Messaging System:
   - Implement real-time messaging with Socket.io
   - Create UI components for messaging system
   - ~~Integrate messaging with user profiles~~ (Done)
   - Implement message threading and reactions (Reactions mostly done, threading UI/State added)

2. Continue implementing features from the Strategy phase:
   - Global Blackboard/Announcements
   - User Profile Management
   - Notification System

## Next Steps
1. **Continue Messaging System implementation (current priority):**
   - **Completed room chat integration with floor plan double-click.** Direct message integration (`message-dialog.tsx`) needs separate trigger (e.g., clicking a user avatar).
   - **Completed integration of user profiles (name/avatar) in `MessageList`.**
   - **Implemented message reactions (UI, optimistic update, API endpoint with DB logic).** (Note: API authentication is placeholder).
   - **Implemented initial message threading UI & State management in `ChatWindow`.**
   - **Next:** Connect `onSendMessage` in `MessagingContext` to handle the `replyToId`.
   - *(Future)* Implement real-time reaction/threading updates via Socket.IO.
   - *(Future)* Replace placeholder authentication in reaction API.
2. Test the Room Management implementation with real users.
3. Update task_list.md to reflect completed tasks.
4. Continue with the implementation of remaining features in the prioritized order.
