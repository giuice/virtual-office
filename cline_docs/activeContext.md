**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the project.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans.
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state.
```
## Current Work Focus:
- **Execute Supabase Migration (Phase 3: Frontend Integration & Testing):** Integrating frontend components with refactored APIs and testing functionality.
    - **Messaging Integration:** Completed initial integration of `MessagingContext` and related hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`, `useSocketEvents`) with refactored Supabase API endpoints via `messagingApi`. Resolved structural issues (duplicate context, hook locations).

## Next Steps:

1.  **Test Messaging Functionality:** Perform end-to-end testing of core messaging features:
    *   Sending/receiving messages in rooms/DMs.
    *   Fetching message history.
    *   Fetching/creating conversations.
    *   Adding/removing reactions.
    *   Archiving/unarchiving conversations.
    *   Marking conversations as read.
    *   Typing indicators.
2.  **Address TODOs:** Review and address TODO comments within the messaging hooks and API client (e.g., error handling, unimplemented attachment uploads).
3.  **(Prerequisite Check):** Ensure Supabase project is created and schema applied (still relevant).

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- **Data Migration:** Confirmed decision: No data migration needed; start fresh.
- **Repository Pattern:** Adopted for data access abstraction. Interfaces and Supabase implementations complete. API routes refactored. Frontend integration in progress.
- **Real-time:** Continue using existing Socket.IO implementation (`socket-server.js`, hooks). Supabase Realtime integration is on hold.
- **Dependency Injection:** Currently using manual instantiation of repositories in API routes; consider a more formal DI approach later if complexity increases.
- **Message Drafts:** Feature temporarily removed due to missing type definition. Revisit later if needed.

## Recent Changes (April 1, 2025)

Created Space Reservation Repository system:

1. Created new repository interface `ISpaceReservationRepository` with methods:
   - `findById`
   - `findBySpace` (paginated)
   - `findByUser` (paginated)  
   - `create`
   - `update`
   - `deleteById`
   - `isSpaceAvailable` (checks time slot availability)

2. Created Supabase implementation `SupabaseSpaceReservationRepository` that:
   - Properly maps between snake_case (DB) and camelCase (TypeScript)
   - Handles pagination for listing methods
   - Validates space availability before reservations
   - Includes proper error handling

3. Fixed reservation handling in Space interface by:
   - Removed `reservations` field from Space type since it's handled by separate table
   - Reservations are now managed through dedicated repository

This change aligns the codebase with the Supabase schema where reservations are stored in a separate `space_reservations` table with proper indexing and foreign key relationships.

## April 2, 2025 - Room Dialog Component Refactoring

### Changes Made
- Refactored the large room-dialog.tsx component (600+ lines) into smaller, more maintainable components
- Created new directory structure: `/components/floor-plan/room-dialog/`
- Split functionality into logical sub-components:
  - RoomHeader: Displays room name, type badge, and features
  - CreateRoomForm: Handles room creation with tabs
  - ViewRoomTabs: Manages viewing room details
  - Tab Components:
    - GeneralTab: Basic room settings
    - FeaturesTab: Room feature management
    - AccessControlTab: Access settings
    - PeopleTab: User management
    - ControlsTab: Room controls
    - ReservationsTab: Reservation management
    - InfoTab: Room information display
- Created utility files:
  - types.ts: Centralized type definitions
  - utils.ts: Shared helper functions

### Impact
- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced type safety with proper interface definitions
- Easier testing and modification of individual components
- Better alignment with database schema (space_reservations table)

### Current State
- Room Dialog component now properly handles reservations from space_reservations table
- Component structure follows single responsibility principle
- Type definitions aligned with Supabase schema
- Ready for integration with real-time updates

### Next Steps
1. Update dependency trackers to reflect new component structure
2. Consider adding tests for new components
3. Implement real-time reservation updates using Supabase
4. Add documentation for new component structure
