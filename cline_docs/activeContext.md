**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the project.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans.
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state.
```
## Current Work Focus:

- **Execute Supabase Migration (Phase 1: Setup & Repositories):** Begin implementing the Supabase migration plan by setting up the Supabase project, applying the schema, and implementing the repository interfaces and Supabase implementations.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Transition to Execution Phase:** Update `.clinerules` and load the Execution Plugin.
2.  **Setup Supabase Project:** Create the project in Supabase, obtain credentials, set environment variables.
3.  **Apply Schema:** Execute `strategy_tasks/supabase_schema_definition.sql` in the Supabase project.
4.  **Implement Repository Interfaces:** Create interfaces in `src/repositories/interfaces/` as per `strategy_tasks/repository_interfaces_definition.md`.
5.  **Implement Supabase Client & Repositories:** Create the client and implementations in `src/lib/supabase/` and `src/repositories/implementations/supabase/` as per `strategy_tasks/supabase_repository_implementation.md`.
6.  **Begin API Refactoring:** Start refactoring the first set of API routes (e.g., Users) according to the relevant instruction file (`api_refactor_users_repo.md`).

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- **Data Migration:** Confirmed decision: No data migration needed; start fresh.
- **Repository Pattern:** Adopted for data access abstraction.
- **Real-time:** Plan is to use Supabase Realtime Subscriptions/Presence/Broadcast.
- **Dependency Injection:** Currently planning manual instantiation of repositories in API routes; consider a more formal DI approach later if complexity increases.
