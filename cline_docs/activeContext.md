- **Next Phase:** Continued Execution
- **Code Root Directory:** src
- **Dependency Status:**

  - `dependency_tracker.md` and mini-trackers updated successfully via `analyze-project`.
  - `doc_tracker.md` status unchanged (no doc directories configured for analysis).

## Recent Changes
- **Floor Plan Debugging & Messaging Fixes (3/29/2025):**
    - **Floor Plan:** Identified that `/floor-plan` page was importing `floor-plan-old.tsx` (with demo data) instead of `floor-plan.tsx` (using context). Corrected the import path in `src/app/(dashboard)/floor-plan/page.tsx`. Confirmed via logs that the database returns an empty `spaces` array, which is now correctly passed to the `FloorPlanCanvas`.
    - **Messaging Build Errors:** Fixing the floor plan import revealed build errors in messaging hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`, `useSocketEvents`) due to incorrect imports and missing functions/types.
    - **Fixes Applied:**
        - Corrected import syntax in hooks to use the named `messagingApi` export from `src/lib/messaging-api.ts`.
        - Corrected type imports (`FileAttachment` instead of `MessageAttachment`) and definitions (`PaginationOptions` defined inline, `TypingIndicator` defined locally) in `useMessages.ts` and `useSocketEvents.ts`.
        - Commented out calls to unimplemented API functions in hooks (`addReaction`, `removeReaction`, `uploadAttachment`, `setConversationArchiveStatus`, `markConversationAsRead`, `updateMessageStatus`, `sendTypingIndicator`) with TODO notes.
        - Removed non-existent `lastMessage` property assignment in `useConversations.ts`.
- **Floor Plan Data Refactor (3/29/2025):**
    - Identified that `floor-plan.tsx` was using hardcoded demo data (`demoSpaces`) instead of fetching real data.
    - Added `Space` type definition to `src/types/database.ts` and deprecated the old `Room` type.
    - Created API endpoint (`/api/spaces/get`) and API client function (`getSpacesByCompany`) to fetch spaces.
    - Updated `CompanyContext` to fetch and provide `spaces` data.
    - Refactored `floor-plan.tsx`, `FloorPlanCanvas.tsx`, `RoomDialog.tsx`, and `RoomManagement.tsx` to use the global `Space` type and consume data from `CompanyContext`. This is expected to fix the bug where users were not displaying correctly in rooms.
- **Invitation Flow Fix (3/29/2025):** Resolved `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` error in `src/pages/accept-invite.tsx`.
- **Invitation Flow Logging (3/28/2025):** Added `console.log` statements to key files:
    - `src/pages/api/invitations/create.ts`
    - `src/pages/api/invitations/accept.ts`
    - `src/components/dashboard/invite-user-dialog.tsx`
    - `src/pages/accept-invite.tsx`
- **Dependency Tracker Maintenance (3/28/2025):** Ran `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor analyze-project` to update module and mini-trackers based on recent code changes.
- **Messaging System Real-Time Updates (Socket.IO):**
  - *socket-server.js*:
    - Added `update_reaction` event listener to receive reaction updates from clients.
    - Implemented broadcasting of `reaction_updated` event to other clients upon receiving `update_reaction`.
    - Ensured `send_message` handler correctly broadcasts the `replyToId` when present in the message payload.
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*:
    - Modified `addReaction` function to emit `update_reaction` event to the server *after* the API call succeeds.
    - Added a socket listener for `reaction_updated` event from the server to handle reaction updates from *other* users, updating local state while avoiding conflicts with optimistic updates.
    - Verified `receive_message` listener handles `replyToId` correctly (implicit in existing logic).
- **User Invitation Flow Refactor (Token-Based):**
  - **Issue:** Identified that invited users were prompted to create a company because the initial user profile creation used a generated UUID, while the application lookup used the Firebase UID after login.
  - **Solution:** Implemented a token-based invitation flow (Option C).
  - *src/types/database.ts*: Added `Invitation` interface definition.
  - *src/lib/dynamo.ts*: Added `INVITATIONS` table name. Implemented `createInvitation`, `getInvitationByToken`, `updateInvitationStatus` functions. Fixed TypeScript errors related to `expiresAt` type handling.
  - *src/pages/api/invitations/create.ts*: Created new API endpoint to generate invitation tokens and save invitation records to the database.
  - *src/pages/api/invitations/accept.ts*: Created new API endpoint to validate tokens, link authenticated users (using Firebase UID as primary key), and create/update user profiles.
  - *src/components/dashboard/invite-user-dialog.tsx*: Modified to call `/api/invitations/create` instead of `createUserProfile`. Removed `displayName` field.
  - *src/pages/accept-invite.tsx*: Created new page to handle invitation links, prompt login/signup, and call `/api/invitations/accept` post-authentication. Fixed TypeScript errors related to `AuthContext` loading state and `useSearchParams` null check. Removed non-existent `Alert` component usage.
  - *src/contexts/CompanyContext.tsx*: Removed unused `createUserProfile` function. Fixed previous TypeScript errors related to `uuid` and `UserRole` imports.
- **Messaging System Implementation (Previous):**
  - *ChatWindow.tsx*: Added state (`replyingToMessage`) and handlers (`handleStartReply`, `handleCancelReply`) for managing reply context. Passed necessary props down to `MessageList` and `MessageInput`.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added `onStartReply` prop, reply button, and visual indicator for replied messages.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageInput.tsx*: Modified props to accept `replyingToMessage` and `onCancelReply`. Added UI to display reply context and cancel button. Updated `handleSend` to pass `replyToId`. Fixed `useRef` import.
  - *src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts*: Implemented database logic using `getDocument` and `updateDocument` to add/remove reactions in DynamoDB. (Authentication still uses placeholder).
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `fetch` call within `addReaction` to send data to the `/api/messages/react` endpoint.
  - Created placeholder API route `src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts` for handling reactions.
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `addReaction` function (with optimistic update logic) and exposed it via context.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Connected `handleSelectReaction` to call the context's `addReaction` function.
  - *socket-server.js*: Updated `send_message` handler to check for and log `replyToId` (placeholder for backend processing).
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added reaction selection popover UI. Imported Popover components, wrapped reaction button in trigger, added PopoverContent with emoji buttons connected to placeholder `handleSelectReaction` function.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added initial UI for message reactions (button appears on hover, calls placeholder function).
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Updated to use `companyUsers` from `CompanyContext` to display the correct sender name and avatar for messages, replacing the placeholder logic.
  - *src/components/floor-plan/floor-plan.tsx*: Modified `onSpaceDoubleClick` handler to trigger `handleOpenChat`, integrating the room chat panel with floor plan double-click interaction.
  - Added initial API endpoints for messaging functionality:
    - *src/app/api/messages/create/route.ts*: Created endpoint for sending new messages
    - *src/app/api/messages/get/route.ts*: Created endpoint for retrieving messages with pagination
    - *src/app/api/conversations/create/route.ts*: Created endpoint for creating new conversations
    - *src/app/api/conversations/get/route.ts*: Created endpoint for retrieving conversations with filtering
  - Enhanced FloorPlanCanvas.tsx with onSpaceDoubleClick event for chat integration
  - Updated room-management.tsx to support opening chat for specific rooms
  - Added uuid dependency for generating unique IDs for messages and conversations
  - Installed `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` dependencies.
  - Created `src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx` with basic Socket.IO client setup.
  - Created `socket-server.js` for standalone Socket.IO server during development.
  - Integrated `MessagingProvider` into `src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Added temporary test component to `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`.
  - **Verified Socket.IO connection** using the test component and confirmed basic message state update logic in `MessagingContext`.
  - **Created initial UI component structure** for messaging in `src/components/messaging/`:
    - `ChatWindow.tsx`: Container for displaying conversations.
    - `MessageList.tsx`: Component to render lists of messages.
    - `MessageInput.tsx`: Component for composing and sending messages.
    - `RoomMessaging.tsx`: Wrapper for room-specific chat panels. Integrated with `MessagingContext`.
    - `ConversationList.tsx`: Placeholder for listing direct message conversations.
  - **Integrated UI with Context:**
    - *src/components/messaging/RoomMessaging.tsx*: Connected to `MessagingContext` to filter messages by `roomId` and use `sendMessage`.
    - *src/components/floor-plan/message-dialog.tsx*: Refactored to use `ChatWindow` and connect to `MessagingContext` for direct messages, generating a `conversationId`. Fixed type error related to user IDs.
- **Dependency Tracker Maintenance:**
  - Updated `doc_tracker.md` and `dependency_tracker.md`, resolving most placeholders. Two placeholders remain in `doc_tracker.md` due to tool limitations with index calculation.
- **Dashboard Layout Improvement:**
  - *src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx*: Refactored layout to prioritize `CompanyOverviewCard` and `QuickLinksGrid`. Removed the large static floor plan link card and the temporary messaging test component.

    - Created and started a standalone development Socket.IO server (`socket-server.js`).
    - Integrated context provider into the application layout.
    - Added a test component to the dashboard.
    - **Verified connection and basic state update:** Confirmed client connects to the server, sends messages, and the `MessagingContext` updates its `messages` state upon receiving `receive_message` events.
    - **Created messaging UI component placeholders:** Added `ChatWindow`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`, `RoomMessaging`, and `ConversationList` in `src/components/messaging/`.
    - **Integrated messaging UI with context:** Connected `RoomMessaging` and `MessageDialog` to `MessagingContext` for basic functionality.
    - **Integrated room chat with floor plan double-click:** Modified `floor-plan.tsx` to open the `RoomChatIntegration` panel when a room is double-clicked.
    - **Integrated user profiles with message display:** Updated `MessageList.tsx` to show sender name/avatar using `CompanyContext`.
    - **Implemented message reactions:**
        - Added UI (button + popover) in `MessageList.tsx`.
        - Connected UI to context (`addReaction`) for optimistic updates.
        - Created API endpoint (`/api/messages/react`) with DB logic (using `getDocument`/`updateDocument`).
        - Connected context `addReaction` to call the API endpoint.
    - **Implemented initial message threading UI & State:**
        - Added reply button and visual indicator in `MessageList.tsx`.
        - Updated `MessageInput.tsx` to display reply context and pass `replyToId`.
        - Added state management for `replyingToMessage` in `ChatWindow.tsx`.
    - **Implemented real-time updates via Socket.IO:**
        - Updated `socket-server.js` to handle `update_reaction` events and broadcast `reaction_updated`. Ensured `replyToId` is broadcast in `receive_message`.
        - Updated `MessagingContext.tsx` to emit `update_reaction` after successful API call and listen for `reaction_updated` from other users.
- **User Invitation Flow:** Refactored to use a token-based system, resolving the ID mismatch issue between invited users and Firebase authentication. Created necessary backend API endpoints, database functions, and frontend pages/components.
- **Dependency Trackers Updated:** Performed maintenance, resolving most placeholders.
- **Improved Dashboard Layout:** Reorganized `dashboard/page.tsx` for better information hierarchy.

## Current Priorities
1. Continue implementing Messaging System:
   - Implement real-time messaging with Socket.io
   - Create UI components for messaging system
   - ~~Integrate messaging with user profiles~~ (Done)
   - Implement message threading and reactions (Reactions mostly done, threading UI/State added)

2. Continue implementing features from the Strategy phase:
   - Global Blackboard/Announcements
   - User Profile Management
   - Notification System

## Next Steps
1. **Continue Messaging System implementation (current priority):**
   - **Completed room chat integration with floor plan double-click.** Direct message integration (`message-dialog.tsx`) needs separate trigger (e.g., clicking a user avatar).
   - **Completed integration of user profiles (name/avatar) in `MessageList`.**
   - **Implemented message reactions (UI, optimistic update, API endpoint with DB logic).** (Note: API authentication is placeholder).
    - **Implemented initial message threading UI & State management in `ChatWindow`.**
    - **Connected `onSendMessage` in `MessagingContext` to handle the `replyToId`:** Updated context function signature and implementation to accept and emit `replyToId`. Fixed resulting TypeScript error related to Date type.
    - **Updated backend socket server (`socket-server.js`)** to acknowledge `replyToId` in the `send_message` event handler (logging only for now).
    - **Implemented real-time broadcasting for reaction and threading updates via Socket.IO.**
    - **Refactored user invitation flow to use tokens and Firebase UID.**
    - **Added logging to invitation flow components and API endpoints.**
    - **Fixed `AuthProvider` issue on `accept-invite` page.**
    - **Next:** Implement missing messaging API functions (Phase 1 of agreed plan): Add backend endpoints and client functions for reactions, status updates, typing indicators, archiving, read status, etc. Then uncomment calls in hooks.
    - *(Phase 2)* Implement "Create Room" functionality (API endpoint, DB logic, context function, connect UI).
    - *(Phase 3/Future)* Refactor messaging components and context for clarity and remove duplicates.
    - *(Future)* Refactor room management functions (update, delete, duplicate) in `floor-plan.tsx` to use API calls instead of modifying local state.
    - *(Future)* Replace placeholder authentication in reaction API.
    - *(Future)* Integrate socket server logic with actual database persistence for messages, reactions, and threads.
    - *(Future)* Add proper authentication/authorization checks to invitation API endpoints.
    - *(Future)* Implement UI for the `/accept-invite` page (replace placeholder).
2. Test the Room Management implementation with real users.
3. Update task_list.md to reflect completed tasks.
4. Continue with the implementation of remaining features in the prioritized order.

## Dependency Information
- Key dependencies identified and updated in `dependency_tracker.md`.
- `doc_tracker.md` updated, but 2 placeholders remain due to tool limitations.
- Package dependencies:
  - Added uuid and @types/uuid for generating unique IDs.
  - Added `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` for real-time messaging.

## Development Guidelines
- **Component Size:** Components exceeding 300-400 lines significantly hinder AI processing. Aggressively decompose large components into smaller, single-responsibility units using SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns principles. Prioritize this during refactoring and new component creation.
