**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the project.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans.
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state.
```
## Current Work Focus:
- **Execute Supabase Migration (Phase 2: API Refactoring & Integration):** Refactoring API routes and integrating frontend calls.
    - User routes: Complete.
    - Company routes (`create`, `get`, `update`, `cleanup`): Complete.
    - Space routes (`get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`): Complete.
    - Conversation routes (`archive`, `create`, `get`, `read`): Complete.
    - Invitation routes (`create`, `accept`): Complete.
    - Message routes (`create`, `get`, `react`, `status`, `typing` [no DB]): Complete.

## Next Steps:

1.  **API Refactoring Complete:** All identified API routes have been refactored to use the Repository pattern.
2.  **Integrate Frontend Messaging:** Update frontend components (`MessagingContext`, hooks, UI) to correctly use the refactored Supabase-backed API endpoints for messages.
2.  **(Prerequisite Check):** Ensure Supabase project is created and schema applied.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- **Data Migration:** Confirmed decision: No data migration needed; start fresh.
- **Repository Pattern:** Adopted for data access abstraction. Interfaces and Supabase implementations complete.
- **Real-time:** Continue using existing Socket.IO implementation (`socket-server.js`, `MessagingContext`). Supabase Realtime integration is on hold.
- **Dependency Injection:** Currently planning manual instantiation of repositories in API routes; consider a more formal DI approach later if complexity increases.
