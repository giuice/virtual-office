# Changelog

## 3/27/2025 (10:44 PM)
- **Messaging System Threading State:**
  - *ChatWindow.tsx*: Added state (`replyingToMessage`) and handlers (`handleStartReply`, `handleCancelReply`) for managing reply context. Passed necessary props down to `MessageList` and `MessageInput`.

## 3/27/2025 (10:38 PM)
- **Messaging System Threading UI:**
  - *MessageList.tsx*: Added `onStartReply` prop, reply button, and visual indicator for replied messages.
  - *MessageInput.tsx*: Modified props to accept `replyingToMessage` and `onCancelReply`. Added UI to display reply context and cancel button. Updated `handleSend` to pass `replyToId`.

## 3/27/2025 (10:30 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction API (DB Logic):**
  - *src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts*: Implemented database logic using `getDocument` and `updateDocument` to fetch the message, calculate updated reactions, and save the changes to DynamoDB. Authentication still uses a placeholder.

## 3/27/2025 (10:18 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction API Call:**
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `fetch` call within `addReaction` function to send reaction data to the `/api/messages/react` endpoint.

## 3/27/2025 (10:14 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction API (Placeholder):**
  - Created placeholder API route `src/app/api/messages/react/route.ts` with a basic POST handler to receive reaction requests.

## 3/27/2025 (10:10 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction Handler Connection:**
  - *src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx*: Added `addReaction` function (with optimistic update logic) and exposed it via context.
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Imported `useMessaging` and updated `handleSelectReaction` to call the context's `addReaction` function.

## 3/27/2025 (10:01 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction UI (Popover):**
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Imported Popover components. Renamed handler to `handleSelectReaction`. Wrapped reaction button in `PopoverTrigger`. Added `PopoverContent` with emoji buttons connected to the new handler.

## 3/27/2025 (9:56 PM)
- **Messaging System Reaction UI (Initial):**
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Added imports for `Button` and `SmilePlus`. Added a placeholder `handleAddReaction` function. Added a reaction button that appears on message hover and calls the placeholder function.

## 3/27/2025 (9:50 PM)
- **Messaging System User Profile Integration:**
  - *src/components/messaging/MessageList.tsx*: Updated to use `companyUsers` from `CompanyContext` to display the correct sender name and avatar for messages, replacing the placeholder logic.

## 3/27/2025 (9:44 PM)
- **Messaging System Floor Plan Integration:**
  - *src/components/floor-plan/floor-plan.tsx*: Modified `onSpaceDoubleClick` handler to call `handleOpenChat` instead of opening the room edit dialog. This integrates the room chat panel with the double-click interaction on the floor plan canvas.

## 3/27/2025 (9:21 PM)
- **Dependency Tracker Maintenance:**
  - Updated `docs/doc_tracker.md` and `cline_docs/dependency_tracker.md`. Resolved all placeholders in `dependency_tracker.md`. Two placeholders remain in `doc_tracker.md` due to tool limitations.

## 3/27/2025 (8:37 PM)
- **Messaging System UI Integration:**
  - *src/components/messaging/RoomMessaging.tsx*: Confirmed integration with `MessagingContext` for room messages.
  - *src/components/floor-plan/message-dialog.tsx*: Refactored to use `ChatWindow` and integrated with `MessagingContext` for direct messages. Fixed user ID type mismatch.

## 3/27/2025 (8:03 PM)
- **Dashboard Layout Improvement:**
  - *src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx*: Refactored layout to prioritize overview and quick links. Removed large static floor plan card and temporary messaging test component.

## 3/27/2025 (7:48 PM)
- **Messaging System UI Components:**
  - Created initial structure and placeholder components in `src/components/messaging/`:
    - `ChatWindow.tsx`: Main container for conversation view.
