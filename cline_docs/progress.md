      - Conversation retrieval endpoint: `/api/conversations/get/route.ts`
    - Integrated API endpoints with the messaging types system
    - Enhanced room components to support messaging:
      - Added room chat integration through FloorPlanCanvas.tsx

   - Add message threading and reactions
3. Follow the implementation order established in the task list for remaining features:
   - Global Blackboard/Announcements
   - User Profile Management
   - Notification System
   - Advanced Communication Tools
4. Conduct regular reviews to ensure alignment with project objectives
5. Update documentation as implementation progresses
