# Engineering Backlog

This backlog collects cross-cutting or future action items that emerge from reviews and planning.

Routing guidance:

- Use this file for non-urgent optimizations, refactors, or follow-ups that span multiple stories/epics.
- Must-fix items to ship a story belong in that story’s `Tasks / Subtasks`.
- Same-epic improvements may also be captured under the epic Tech Spec `Post-Review Follow-ups` section.

| Date | Story | Epic | Type | Severity | Owner | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 2025-10-29 | N/A | 4A/4B | Decision | N/A | Giuliano | Closed | All automated testing (Playwright E2E) eliminated from project scope. Technical assessment: Playwright incompatible with Supabase Realtime complexity - infinite development cycle. Manual testing approach adopted for all Epic 4A/4B stories. Original Story 4A.1 removed, Story 4B.8 eliminated (not deferred). |
