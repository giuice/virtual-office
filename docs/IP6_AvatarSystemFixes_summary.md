# Avatar System Fixes Implementation Plan Summary

## Overview

An implementation plan and related tasks have been created to address critical bugs in the avatar system:

1. **IP6_AvatarSystemFixes** - Main implementation plan for addressing avatar system bugs
   - Covers custom avatar display issues, storage optimization, and avatar group layout fixes
   - Provides a comprehensive approach to resolve all identified avatar-related problems

2. **Task Breakdown**:
   - **T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix** (Highest Priority) - Fixing issues where custom avatars don't display properly
   - **T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix** (High Priority) - Resolving spacing and overlap issues in avatar groups
   - **T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization** (Medium Priority) - Optimizing storage to prevent duplicating images

## Implementation Details

### Avatar Display Fix (T6_1)
- Focuses on fixing the core issue where uploaded avatars aren't displaying in the UI
- Addresses URL construction, cache invalidation, and proper loading states
- Provides enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities

### Avatar Group Layout Fix (T6_3)
- Revises the avatar group component to ensure proper cascading display
- Implements explicit z-index management for correct layering
- Uses inline styles for consistent spacing across all browsers

### Avatar Storage Optimization (T6_2)
- Creates a consistent naming convention for avatar files
- Replaces existing avatars instead of creating new ones
- Adds cleanup functionality for orphaned avatar files

## Next Steps

The system is ready to transition to the Execution phase pending user confirmation. Implementation will begin with the highest priority task (T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix) to ensure users can see their custom avatars properly, followed by the avatar group layout fixes.

All changes have been properly documented in:
- `memorybankrules.md`
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/changelog.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`

Implementation plans and task instructions have been created with detailed steps to guide the execution process.
