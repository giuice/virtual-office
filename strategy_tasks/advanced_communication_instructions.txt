# Advanced Communication Tools Instructions

## Objective
Implement advanced communication features including WebRTC for audio/video calls, enhanced screen sharing capabilities, calendar integration for scheduling, and advanced meeting management tools to create a comprehensive communication platform within the virtual office.

## Context
The virtual office application currently has basic communication features, but lacks advanced tools for real-time audio/video communication, screen sharing, and meeting management. These features are essential for creating a complete virtual office experience that can replace or supplement physical office interactions.

This feature set will require significant new components and integration with external APIs.

## Dependencies
- 2Aa: `src/app` (for communication feature routes)
- 2Ab: `src/components` (for communication UI components)
- 2Ad: `src/contexts` (for communication state management)
- 2Af: `src/lib` (for API calls and utility functions)
- Interactive Floor Plan Completion (for integrating communication tools with floor plan)
- Room Management (for room-based communication)
- User Profile Management (for user availability and status)

## Steps
1. **Implement WebRTC for Audio/Video Calls**
   - Set up WebRTC infrastructure for peer-to-peer connections
   - Implement signaling server for connection establishment
   - Create audio/video call UI components
   - Add call controls (mute, camera toggle, end call)
   - Implement one-on-one and group calling capabilities
   - Add call quality monitoring and optimization

2. **Enhance Screen Sharing Capabilities**
   - Implement screen sharing using WebRTC
   - Add options for sharing entire screen, window, or tab
   - Create screen sharing controls and viewer UI
   - Implement annotation tools for shared screens
   - Add recording capabilities for shared content
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

3. **Integrate Calendar Functionality**
   - Implement calendar UI components
   - Create event creation and management interface
   - Add recurring meeting support
   - Implement calendar synchronization with external calendars (Google, Outlook)
   - Create meeting reminders and notifications
   - Add availability sharing based on calendar events

4. **Develop Advanced Meeting Scheduling**
   - Create meeting scheduling interface
   - Implement participant invitation system
   - Add availability checking for meeting scheduling
   - Create meeting templates for quick scheduling
   - Implement meeting agenda creation tools
   - Add meeting confirmation and reminder system

5. **Create Meeting Management Tools**
   - Implement meeting room UI with participant management
   - Add meeting controls for hosts (mute all, remove participant, etc.)
   - Create waiting room functionality
   - Implement meeting recording and transcription
   - Add breakout room capabilities
   - Create meeting analytics and reporting

6. **Implement Collaborative Tools**
   - Add whiteboard functionality for collaborative drawing
   - Implement document sharing and collaborative editing
   - Create polls and voting tools for meetings
   - Add hand raising and reaction features
   - Implement chat features specific to meetings
   - Create presenter mode with spotlight features

7. **Integrate with Floor Plan and Rooms**
   - Connect communication tools with floor plan rooms
   - Implement visual indicators for active calls/meetings
   - Create smooth transitions between floor plan and communication interfaces
   - Add room-specific communication settings
   - Implement spatial audio for room-based communication (optional)

8. **Optimize Performance and User Experience**
   - Implement bandwidth management for audio/video
   - Add adaptive quality based on network conditions
   - Create fallback mechanisms for poor connections
   - Optimize for mobile and desktop experiences
   - Ensure accessibility compliance for all communication tools

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive WebRTC implementation for audio/video calls
- Enhanced screen sharing with annotation capabilities
- Integrated calendar with external synchronization
- Advanced meeting scheduling and management tools
- Collaborative features for effective virtual meetings
- Seamless integration with floor plan and room system
- Optimized performance across devices and network conditions

## Notes
- Consider using libraries like simple-peer or PeerJS for WebRTC implementation
- Calendar integration may require OAuth for external calendar access
- Screen sharing has different browser security requirements that need to be addressed
- WebRTC requires careful handling of ICE servers and STUN/TURN configuration
- Consider implementing a fallback to WebSockets for environments where WebRTC is blocked
- Meeting recording and transcription may require server-side processing
- Ensure proper permissions and privacy controls for all communication features
