# Room Creation & Management Enhancements Instructions

## Objective
Enhance the room creation and management functionality to provide a more intuitive, feature-rich experience for users creating, editing, and managing rooms in the virtual office floor plan.

## Context
The current room creation and management functionality is implemented primarily in:
- `src/components/floor-plan/room-dialog.tsx`: Dialog for room creation and editing
- `src/components/floor-plan/floor-plan.tsx`: Container component that includes room management logic
- `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanCanvas.tsx`: Canvas component that renders rooms
- `src/components/floor-plan/types.ts`: TypeScript definitions for room-related components

The existing implementation provides basic room creation but needs enhancement to support more advanced features and improve user experience.

## Dependencies
- 2Ab: `src/components` (room management components depend on this module)
- 2Ad: `src/contexts` (may need context for state management)
- 2Af: `src/lib` (utility functions for room management)
- Interactive Floor Plan Completion (related task that enhances floor plan interactivity)

## Steps
1. **Enhance Room Dialog UI/UX**
   - Redesign the room creation/editing dialog for improved usability
   - Add form validation with clear error messages
   - Implement a more intuitive layout with preview capability
   - Add accessibility features to ensure the dialog is fully accessible

2. **Implement Advanced Room Properties**
   - Add support for room types (meeting room, open space, private office, etc.)
   - Implement room capacity settings with visual indicators
   - Add room status options (available, in-use, reserved, etc.)
   - Support for room scheduling and reservation

3. **Create Room Templates**
   - Implement predefined room templates for quick creation
   - Allow saving custom room configurations as templates
   - Add template management (create, edit, delete)
   - Implement template preview functionality

4. **Enhance Room Management Controls**
   - Add bulk operations for rooms (select multiple, move, delete)
   - Implement room grouping functionality
   - Add room filtering and sorting options
   - Create a dedicated room management panel/sidebar

5. **Implement Room Permissions and Access Control**
   - Add room locking/unlocking functionality
   - Implement user access controls for rooms
   - Create admin-only room management features
   - Add audit logging for room changes

6. **Optimize Room Data Management**
   - Implement efficient data structures for room storage
   - Add real-time synchronization for room changes
   - Optimize room rendering performance
   - Implement data validation and error handling

## Expected Output
- Enhanced room-dialog component with improved UI/UX
- Updated floor-plan component with advanced room management features
- New room template system for efficient room creation
- Comprehensive room management controls
- Room permission system for access control
- Optimized room data management for performance

## Notes
- Consider using a form library like react-hook-form or formik for improved form handling
- Room templates should be stored in a way that allows for easy sharing between users
- Ensure all new features maintain compatibility with the existing floor plan implementation
- Room management should scale well for both small and large floor plans
- Consider implementing undo/redo functionality for room management operations
