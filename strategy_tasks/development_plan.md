# Development Plan

## Overview of Current State
- Dependency Tracker keys have been generated.
- The code root directory ("src") is defined.
- Essential documentation (activeContext, project brief, changelog, etc.) is up to date.
- The project has completed its Set-up/Maintenance phase.

## Next Steps
1. Update the Active Context:
   - Enrich cline_docs/activeContext.md with a detailed summary of the current configuration, recent changes, and dependency information.
2. Document and Prioritize Tasks:
   - Create a list of immediate and upcoming tasks.
   - Prioritize these tasks based on impact and urgency, and document them in this plan.
3. Transition to the Strategy Phase:
   - Develop a detailed plan that outlines feature enhancements, refactoring opportunities, and further improvements.
4. Prepare for Execution:
   - Once the strategy is finalized, proceed to implement and test the planned tasks in the next phase.

This plan will guide the transition from the current set-up phase to active development.
