# Global Blackboard/Announcements System Instructions

## Objective
Create a comprehensive global blackboard and announcements system that allows company-wide communication, enabling users to post, view, and interact with announcements in real-time across the virtual office application.

## Context
The virtual office application currently lacks a centralized communication system for company-wide announcements. A global blackboard system is needed to facilitate important communications, announcements, and shared information that should be visible to all users within a company workspace.

This feature will require new components and potentially new routes in the application structure.

## Dependencies
- 2Aa: `src/app` (for creating new routes for the blackboard)
- 2Ab: `src/components` (for creating blackboard UI components)
- 2Ad: `src/contexts` (for announcement state management)
- 2Af: `src/lib` (for API calls and utility functions)

## Steps
1. **Design and Implement Announcement Data Model**
   - Define announcement data structure (title, content, author, timestamp, expiration, etc.)
   - Create announcement categories/types (important, general, event, etc.)
   - Implement visibility and targeting options (all users, specific departments, etc.)
   - Design database schema for announcement storage

2. **Create Blackboard Context and State Management**
   - Implement a BlackboardContext for global announcement state
   - Create hooks for announcement operations (post, edit, delete, pin)
   - Set up real-time announcement synchronization
   - Implement announcement filtering and sorting

3. **Develop Blackboard UI Components**
   - Create a main blackboard view component
   - Implement announcement cards with rich content support
   - Add announcement creation/editing interface
   - Design announcement detail view

4. **Implement Blackboard Navigation and Access**
   - Add blackboard link to main navigation
   - Create a dedicated blackboard page/route
   - Implement a mini-blackboard widget for dashboard
   - Add notification indicators for new announcements

5. **Add Announcement Interaction Features**
   - Implement announcement reactions (like, acknowledge, etc.)
   - Add commenting functionality on announcements
   - Create announcement sharing options
   - Implement announcement bookmarking

6. **Develop Admin Controls and Management**
   - Create admin-only announcement management interface
   - Implement announcement moderation features
   - Add announcement analytics (views, interactions)
   - Create announcement templates for quick posting

7. **Integrate with Other Application Features**
   - Connect announcements with calendar for event announcements
   - Integrate with notification system
   - Add announcement references in floor plan (e.g., event locations)
   - Implement announcement search in global search

8. **Optimize Performance and User Experience**
   - Implement efficient announcement loading and pagination
   - Add animations and transitions for a polished experience
   - Optimize for mobile and desktop views
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive blackboard system for company-wide announcements
- Rich announcement creation and viewing interface
- Real-time announcement updates and notifications
- Admin controls for announcement management
- Integration with other application features
- Responsive and accessible user interface

## Notes
- Consider using a rich text editor like Draft.js or Slate for announcement content
- Announcements should support markdown or rich formatting for better readability
- Consider implementing announcement scheduling for future posting
- Design the system to handle both persistent and temporary announcements
- Ensure proper permissions and access controls for announcement management
- Consider implementing announcement archiving for historical reference
