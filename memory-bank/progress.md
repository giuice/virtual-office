## Current Status

The project is in the early development phase with the following status:

| Area | Status | Progress |
|------|--------|----------|
| User Authentication | Functional | 90% |
| Company Management | Functional | 85% |
| Database Foundation | In Progress | 60% |
| UI Components | Functional | 80% |
| Floor Plan | In Development | 40% |
| Real-time Features | In Development | 20% |
| AI Features | Not Started | 0% |

**Overall Project Status**: ~50% complete for MVP (excluding AI features)

## Known Issues

1. **DynamoDB Optimization Challenges**:
   - Need to improve query efficiency for larger datasets
   - API abstraction needs refinement for better performance
   - Consider implementing caching for frequent queries

2. **Authentication Edge Cases**:
   - Handling authentication token expiration
   - Refresh token mechanism needs improvement

3. **UI/UX Refinements Needed**:
   - Some UI components need accessibility improvements
   - Mobile responsiveness has minor issues in some views

4. **Performance Concerns**:
   - Dashboard initial load time optimization needed
   - Company data loading could be more efficient

5. **Testing Gaps**:
   - Lack of comprehensive test coverage
   - Need automated tests for critical flows

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Complete DynamoDB performance optimization
2. Implement interactive floor plan with basic room functionality
3. Add real-time presence and status updates using DynamoDB Streams
4. Develop messaging functionality between users
5. Create room-based collaboration tools
