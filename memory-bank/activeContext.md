# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Virtual Office project is currently focusing on enhancing and optimizing the AWS DynamoDB database implementation that has been established. The primary goal is to build upon this foundation to support the core features of the virtual office platform, with particular emphasis on:

1. **Company-based Data Isolation**: Ensuring that data is properly partitioned by company to maintain security and privacy using DynamoDB's Global Secondary Indexes
2. **User Authentication and Management**: Strengthening the integration between Firebase Authentication and the DynamoDB backend
3. **Dashboard UI Implementation**: Building out the core user interface components that will facilitate team collaboration
4. **Floor Plan Development**: Creating the interactive virtual office environment with real-time data from DynamoDB tables

## Recent Changes

1. **AWS Integration**: Initial implementation of AWS DynamoDB for data storage with server-side configuration
2. **Company Context Provider**: Implementation of the CompanyContext provider that manages company and user data
3. **Dashboard UI Components**: Creation of dashboard layout, navigation, and company overview components
4. **API Client Development**: Established API client functions in `/lib/api.ts` following the repository pattern
5. **Company Cleanup Functionality**: Added logic to handle and clean up duplicate company records

## Current Decisions

### Database Improvements Strategy

Improvements on AWS Dynamo :

4. **API Abstraction**: Maintain a clean API abstraction layer to isolate database implementation details from business logic

### UI/UX Approach

1. **Minimalist Design**: The dashboard UI follows a clean, minimalist approach with cards for different functions
2. **Role-Based UI**: Different UI elements are shown based on user role (admin vs. member)
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Quick links to floor plan, team members, messages, calendar, and settings

### Technical Architecture

1. **Context-Based State Management**: Using React Context for state management instead of Redux or other libraries
2. **Next.js API Routes**: Leveraging Next.js API routes for serverless backend functionality
3. **Component Modularity**: Structuring components to be modular and reusable

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities

1. **DynamoDB Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Refine Global Secondary Indexes for common access patterns
   - Add monitoring and error tracking for database operations
   - Create comprehensive database backup strategy

2. **Floor Plan Implementation**:
   - Develop interactive floor plan component
   - Add room creation and management functionality
   - Implement user positioning and movement

3. **Real-time Features**:
   - Add WebSocket connection for real-time presence updates
   - Implement real-time messaging
   - Enable real-time room occupancy tracking
   - Integrate with DynamoDB Streams for real-time data synchronization

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Complete the user profile management features
   - Enhance status indicators and presence awareness
   - Implement notification system

### Medium-term Objectives

1. **Audio/Video Communication**:
   - Integrate WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
   - Implement room-based conversations
   - Add screen sharing capability

2. **Initial AI Features**:
   - Research and integrate speech-to-text services
   - Implement basic transcription for meetings
   - Develop meeting summary functionality

## Active Technical Challenges

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent real-time updates across multiple users
2. **DynamoDB Performance**: Optimizing queries and table design for better performance
3. **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining responsive UI with increasing data and real-time features
4. **Authentication Integration**: Seamlessly connecting Firebase Authentication with the DynamoDB backend
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring WebRTC and other features work across different browsers

## Current Testing Focus

1. **Authentication Flow**: Validating user sign-up, login, and session management
2. **Company Creation**: Testing the company creation and user invitation process
3. **Data Isolation**: Verifying that company data is properly isolated between organizations
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensuring the dashboard works well on different screen sizes

The active development approach emphasizes iterative improvements, focusing on establishing core functionality before adding more advanced AI-powered features. This strategy allows for faster delivery of an MVP while setting the foundation for more sophisticated capabilities in future releases.
