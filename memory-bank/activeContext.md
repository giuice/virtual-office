# Active Context

## Current Project State
Currently executing IP4 v2. Completed T4_1 token refinement and docs update; moving to T4_2 SpaceCard implementation.

## Recent Actions
- Confirmed Strategy phase for IP4 re-plan.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI_v2 plan validated.
- T4_1..T4_6 v2 tasks exist with instructions; priorities updated.
- Progress and priorities verified; transition to Execution next.

## Next Steps
- Continue T4_2_SpaceCardComponent_v2: implement header/status/occupancy and interactions.

## Dependencies
- T4 tasks depend on Tailwind v4 configuration, Shadcn/UI components, presence hooks/contexts, and existing DOM floor plan components for reference/replacement.

## Potential Issues
- Risk: Regressions in Tailwind v4 migration and DOM-based layout performance; ensure no Konva dependencies remain. Accessibility must be preserved.

## Progress Summary
- IP1_PresenceBugsResolution: 100% complete.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI: being re-planned (v2).
- IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification: 100% complete.
- Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration: 100% complete.
- Task T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem: to be refreshed for v2.
- Task T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime: 100% complete.

## Environment Notes
- Current mode: crct

## Mandatory Updates
This file reflects Execution phase progress for IP4 v2.

## Current Focus
- Re-planning Modern Floor Plan UI (IP4 v2)
- Ensuring Tailwind v4 alignment and DOM-first approach
- Preparing refreshed T4 tasks for execution

## Recent Major Changes
- T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime completed:
  - Removed useSocketEvents.ts and all Socket.io dependencies
  - Implemented robust Supabase Realtime subscriptions for messages and conversations
  - Added proper error handling and connection status tracking
  - Removed typing indicators functionality (could be reimplemented using Supabase broadcast channels if needed)
  - Enhanced cleanup of subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

## Current System State
- Messaging system now exclusively uses Supabase Realtime for:
  - Real-time message updates (new messages, edits, reactions)
  - Conversation status changes
  - Connection status monitoring
- Implementation follows the same pattern as useSpaceRealtime
- React Query integration for efficient cache management
- Enhanced logging for better debugging capabilities

## Known Issues/Limitations
- Authentication errors (401) when trying to send messages need to be addressed
- Server errors (500) in message creation endpoint require investigation
- Typing indicators functionality removed but could be reimplemented using Supabase broadcast channels

## Upcoming Work
- Address authentication issues in messaging API endpoints
- Investigate and fix server errors in message creation
- Consider reimplementing typing indicators using Supabase broadcast channels if needed
- Begin work on T4_2_SpaceCardComponent leveraging updated tokens (Step 1 completed: wrapper scaffold created)

## Technical Notes
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions configured with:
  - 5-second retry intervals
  - 10-second timeouts
  - Proper cleanup on unmount
  - Connection status tracking
- React Query cache integration for optimistic updates
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the system
