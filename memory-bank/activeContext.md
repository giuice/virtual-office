# Active Context

## Current Project State
Phase: Execution. We're about to begin implementing the avatar system fixes identified in IP6_AvatarSystemFixes. We have completed T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime and previously identified issues with the avatar system that need to be fixed, including custom avatar display problems, redundant storage, and avatar group layout issues.

## Recent Actions
- Completed T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime.
- Identified avatar system bugs: custom avatars not displaying properly, duplicate images being created, and avatar group layout issues.
- Created Implementation Plan: `IP6_AvatarSystemFixes.md`.
- Created Task Instructions: `T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix_instructions.md`, `T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization_instructions.md`, and `T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix_instructions.md`.
- Updated `progress.md` to include IP6 and related tasks.
- Completed Step 1 of T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: Investigated URL formats and added comprehensive diagnostic tools.
- Completed Step 2 of T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: Identified and fixed the root cause - Supabase bucket was not set to public.
- Completed Step 3 of T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: Enhanced image loading with better error handling, caching, and fallback mechanisms.
- Completed Step 4 of T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: Implemented a robust cache invalidation system for avatar updates.
- Completed Step 5 of T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: Verified and tested avatar display fixes across different scenarios and components.
- Completed Step 1 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Implemented consistent avatar naming convention (avatar-{userId}.{extension}) in the upload API.
- Completed Step 2 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Added logic to check for existing avatars before upload in the API route.
- Completed Step 3 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Implemented avatar replacement strategy (remove existing files then upload new one) to handle different file types.
- Completed Step 4 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Created utility function `cleanupOrphanedAvatars` in `src/server/storage-cleanup.ts`.
- Completed Step 5 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Verified User Repository Interface already supports avatar URL updates.
- Completed Step 6 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Enhanced error handling, validation, and rollback logic in the avatar upload API (`src/app/api/users/avatar/route.ts`).
- Completed Step 7 of T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: Tested optimization scenarios successfully.
- Completed Task T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization.

## Next Steps
- Start Task T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix: Fix avatar group layout issues.
- Follow the execution steps in `memory-bank/tasks/T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix_instructions.md`.

## Dependencies
- T6_1 depends on Supabase client configuration, avatar components, and user repository.
- T6_2 depends on avatar upload/removal APIs and Supabase storage.
- T6_3 depends on AvatarGroup component and related UI components.

## Potential Issues
- Avatar URL construction may have inconsistencies across different components.
- Storage optimization might require careful handling to avoid data loss.
- Browser-specific rendering differences may affect avatar group layout fixes.

## Progress Summary
- IP1_PresenceBugsResolution: 100% complete.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI: 20% complete (Task T4_1 is in progress).
- IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification: 100% complete.
- IP6_AvatarSystemFixes: 67% complete (T6_1, T6_2 completed).
- Task T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem: 50% complete (In Progress).
- Task T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime: 100% complete.
- Task T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix: 100% (Completed) [IP6_AvatarSystemFixes]
- Task T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization: 100% complete (Completed).
- Task T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix: 0% complete (Not started).

## Mandatory Updates
This file has been updated to reflect the latest actions and state.

## Current Focus
- Addressing avatar system bugs
- Fixing issues with custom avatar rendering and storage
- Improving avatar group component spacing issues

## Recent Major Changes
- T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime completed:
  - Removed useSocketEvents.ts and all Socket.io dependencies
  - Implemented robust Supabase Realtime subscriptions for messages and conversations
  - Added proper error handling and connection status tracking
  - Removed typing indicators functionality (could be reimplemented using Supabase broadcast channels if needed)
  - Enhanced cleanup of subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

## Current System State
- Messaging system now exclusively uses Supabase Realtime for real-time updates
- Implementation follows the same pattern as useSpaceRealtime
- React Query integration for efficient cache management
- Enhanced logging for better debugging capabilities
- Avatar system currently experiencing issues with custom avatar display, storage optimization, and group layouts

## Known Issues/Limitations
- Custom avatars not displaying properly despite successful storage
- Multiple avatar images created when users update their profile pictures
- Avatar group component has spacing and overlap issues
- Authentication errors (401) when trying to send messages need to be addressed
- Server errors (500) in message creation endpoint require investigation

## Upcoming Work
- Address avatar system bugs through tasks T6_1, T6_2, and T6_3
- Continue work on T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem for modernizing floor plan UI when avatar fixes are complete

## Technical Notes
- Supabase storage is being used for avatar images
- Current avatar URL construction may need review for proper public access
- AvatarGroup component needs more robust positioning and z-index management
