# Active Context

## Current Work Focus:
- **Phase:** Strategy
- **Focus Area:** Critical Presence System Bugs
- **Current Tasks:** Planning fixes for avatar display, state management, space interaction, and realtime integration issues
- **Implementation Plan:** IP1_PresenceBugsResolution

## Next Steps:
1. Switch to Execution phase to implement T1_2_StateManagement (highest priority):
   - Fix 404 errors in space updates
   - Resolve infinite console updates
   - Optimize state management
2. Then implement T1_1_AvatarSystem and T1_3_SpaceInteraction
3. Finally cleanup Socket.io with T1_4_RealtimeIntegration

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Moving away from userIds in spaces table to current_space_id in users table
- Transitioning from Socket.io to Supabase realtime
- Need to handle PGRST116 errors properly in space updates
- Optimizing debug logging and state updates

## Recent Changes Summary

- **Apr 9:** Identified root causes of avatar, state management, and interaction issues
- **Apr 9:** Created tasks T1_1 through T1_4 with detailed instructions
- **Apr 9:** Prioritized tasks with state management as highest priority
