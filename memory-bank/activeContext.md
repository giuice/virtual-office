**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the project.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans.
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state.

## Current Work Focus:
- **Phase**: Execution
- **Focus Area**: Implementing fixes for messaging and conversations system
- **Current Tasks**: 
  - T1_MessagingAPICompletion - âœ… Completed implementation of messaging API functions and routes
  - T2_RepositoryEnhancement - Ensure repositories fully implement their interfaces
  - T3_ReactQueryMigration - Refactor messaging hooks to use React Query
  - T4_RealtimeMessaging - Implement Supabase Realtime for messaging

## Next Steps:
1. Complete manual testing for the implemented messaging API features
   - Verify file uploads, message status updates, typing indicators functionality
   - Ensure conversation archive and read status features work correctly
2. Proceed with T2_RepositoryEnhancement
   - Ensure message and conversation repositories fully implement interfaces
3. Implement T3_ReactQueryMigration
   - Refactor messaging hooks to use React Query
4. Implement T4_RealtimeMessaging
   - Set up Supabase Realtime for messaging

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Testing Strategy:** Developed an alternative testing approach for Next.js App Router API routes due to challenges with direct unit testing. Focus on testing core logic separately from route handlers.
- **Messaging System Architecture:** Need to evaluate current messaging architecture and identify improvements for reliability and performance.
- **Real-time Updates for Messages:** Consider how to best implement real-time updates for messages using Supabase Realtime and React Query.
- **Firebase UID vs Database UUID:** Implemented a solution to handle the mismatch between Firebase UIDs and database UUIDs by detecting ID format and converting as needed.
- **Server State Management:** Adopted **React Query** for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state, replacing the need for custom context providers (like the planned `SpaceContext`).
- **UI State Management:** Plan to use **Zustand** for managing client-side UI state (e.g., selected items, filters) once React Query is integrated.
- **Repository Pattern:** Adopted for data access abstraction. Interfaces and Supabase implementations complete. API routes refactored. React Query hooks will use repositories.
- **Real-time:** Implemented Supabase Realtime with React Query for automatic cache invalidation. Existing Socket.IO implementation (`socket-server.js`, hooks) remains for messaging until fully migrated/replaced.

## Recent Changes Summary (See changelog.md for details)
- **Apr 4:** Completed implementation of messaging API features (file attachments, message status, typing indicators, conversation archive/read status) and corresponding API routes with proper handling of Firebase UID vs Database UUID mismatch.
- **Apr 4:** Transitioned to Execution phase to implement fixes for messaging and conversations system.
- **Apr 4:** Fixed critical error in the invitation system where Firebase UIDs were being used directly in database operations expecting UUIDs. Implemented ID format detection and conversion in API routes.
- **Apr 4:** Implemented user avatars in the floor plan with tooltips showing user information. Implemented space persistence across sessions with the `useLastSpace` hook to ensure users remain in their selected space even after logging out and back in.
- **Apr 4:** Integrated React Query mutation hooks into components. Updated `FloorPlan` component to use `useUpdateSpace` hook for the `handleEnterSpace` function, replacing the TODO comment with proper implementation.
- **Apr 2:** Implemented React Query mutation hooks (`useCreateSpace`, `useUpdateSpace`, `useDeleteSpace`) for spaces. Set up React Query, implemented space query hooks, refactored FloorPlan component. Fixed LocalSpace type definitions. Refactored RoomDialog component into smaller units.
