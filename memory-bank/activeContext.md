# Active Context

## Current Project State
Transitioned to Execution phase. Task T1_4 is complete. Due to identifying incomplete realtime migration in the messaging system, planning was done in Strategy phase to address this. The next task is the newly created T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime, which is now prioritized over T4_1.

## Recent Actions
- Identified incomplete messaging realtime migration (post-T1_4).
- Transitioned to Strategy phase.
- Created Implementation Plan: `IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification.md`.
- Created Task Instructions: `T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime_instructions.md`.
- Updated `progress.md` to include IP5, T5_1, and set T5_1 as highest priority.
- Transitioned back to Execution phase.

## Next Steps
- Initialize Execution Phase: Load Execution plugin and core files.
- Start execution of T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime, beginning with Step 1: Analyze Current State.

## Dependencies
- T5_1 depends heavily on messaging context, hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`), Supabase client, and consuming UI components.

## Potential Issues
- High risk of performance issues or update loops if Supabase subscriptions are not implemented carefully in T5_1. Requires thorough testing.

## Progress Summary
- IP1_PresenceBugsResolution: 100% complete.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI: 0% complete.
- IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification: 0% complete (Task T5_1 is starting).
- Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration: 100% complete.
- Task T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem: 0% complete (Deferred).
- Task T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime: 0% complete.
