# Active Context

## Current Project State
Transitioned to Execution phase. Task T1_4 is complete. Due to identifying incomplete realtime migration in the messaging system, planning was done in Strategy phase to address this. The next task is the newly created T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime, which is now prioritized over T4_1.

## Recent Actions
- Identified incomplete messaging realtime migration (post-T1_4).
- Transitioned to Strategy phase.
- Created Implementation Plan: `IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification.md`.
- Created Task Instructions: `T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime_instructions.md`.
- Updated `progress.md` to include IP5, T5_1, and set T5_1 as highest priority.
- Transitioned back to Execution phase.

## Next Steps
- Initialize Execution Phase: Load Execution plugin and core files.
- Start execution of T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime, beginning with Step 1: Analyze Current State.

## Dependencies
- T5_1 depends heavily on messaging context, hooks (`useMessages`, `useConversations`), Supabase client, and consuming UI components.

## Potential Issues
- High risk of performance issues or update loops if Supabase subscriptions are not implemented carefully in T5_1. Requires thorough testing.

## Progress Summary
- IP1_PresenceBugsResolution: 100% complete.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI: 0% complete.
- IP5_MessagingRealtimeUnification: 0% complete (Task T5_1 is starting).
- Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration: 100% complete.
- Task T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem: 0% complete (Deferred).
- Task T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime: 0% complete.

## Mandatory Updates
This file has been updated to reflect the latest actions and state.

## Current Focus
- Addressing avatar system bugs
- Fixing issues with custom avatar rendering and storage
- Improving avatar group component spacing issues

## Recent Major Changes
- T5_1_RefactorMessagingRealtime completed:
  - Removed useSocketEvents.ts and all Socket.io dependencies
  - Implemented robust Supabase Realtime subscriptions for messages and conversations
  - Added proper error handling and connection status tracking
  - Removed typing indicators functionality (could be reimplemented using Supabase broadcast channels if needed)
  - Enhanced cleanup of subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

## Current System State
- Messaging system now exclusively uses Supabase Realtime for:
  - Real-time message updates (new messages, edits, reactions)
  - Conversation status changes
  - Connection status monitoring
- Implementation follows the same pattern as useSpaceRealtime
- React Query integration for efficient cache management
- Enhanced logging for better debugging capabilities

## Known Issues/Limitations
- Authentication errors (401) when trying to send messages need to be addressed
- Server errors (500) in message creation endpoint require investigation
- Typing indicators functionality removed but could be reimplemented using Supabase broadcast channels

## Upcoming Work
- Address authentication issues in messaging API endpoints
- Investigate and fix server errors in message creation
- Consider reimplementing typing indicators using Supabase broadcast channels if needed
- Begin work on T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem for modernizing floor plan UI

## Technical Notes
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions configured with:
  - 5-second retry intervals
  - 10-second timeouts
  - Proper cleanup on unmount
  - Connection status tracking
- React Query cache integration for optimistic updates
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the system
