# Active Context

## Current Project State
Transitioned back to Execution phase after resolving a task instruction mismatch. Task T1_4 is complete. The next task is T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem. The instruction file for T4_1 was corrected by merging content and deleting an incorrectly named file.

## Recent Actions
- Completed Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration.
- Identified missing instruction file for T4_1, triggering transition to Strategy.
- Corrected task naming inconsistency: Merged content from mistakenly created `T4_1_ModernUIComponents_instructions.md` into the correct `T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem_instructions.md`.
- Deleted `virtual-office/memory-bank/tasks/T4_1_ModernUIComponents_instructions.md`.
- Updated `IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI.md` to reference the correct T4_1 task name.
- Transitioned back to Execution phase.

## Next Steps
- Initialize Execution Phase: Load Execution plugin and core files.
- Start execution of T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem, beginning with Step 1: Analyze & Define Visual Style.

## Dependencies
- T4_1 depends on UI libraries (Tailwind, Shadcn) and type definitions.

## Potential Issues
- Ensure visual style defined in T4_1 aligns with overall project aesthetics.

## Progress Summary
- IP1_PresenceBugsResolution: 100% complete.
- IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI: 0% complete (Task T4_1 is starting).
- Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration: 100% complete.
- Task T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem: 0% complete.
