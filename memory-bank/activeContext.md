# Active Context

## Current Project State
The Virtual Office app is in the Execution phase. Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration is complete. Socket.io remnants were removed, Supabase realtime configuration was verified, and the presence system (`useUserPresence` hook) was updated to track and expose connection status. UI implementation for monitoring was deferred.

## Recent Actions
- Completed Step 4 of T1_4_RealtimeIntegration (considered complete by deferring UI work).
- Completed Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration.
- Updated `virtual-office/memory-bank/tasks/T1_4_RealtimeIntegration_instructions.md` to mark Step 4 as complete.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with the next prioritized task: T4_1_ModernUIComponents (Implement modern UI components for floor plan).
- Load the instruction file for T4_1.
- Begin execution of T4_1 steps.

## Dependencies
- T4_1 will likely involve creating new UI components and potentially modifying existing floor plan related files.

## Potential Issues
- UI work for T1_4 connection status monitoring is deferred and needs to be tracked for future implementation.

## Progress Summary

- Task T1_4_RealtimeIntegration: 100% complete.
