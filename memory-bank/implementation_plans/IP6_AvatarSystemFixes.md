# IP6_AvatarSystemFixes

## Overview
This implementation plan addresses critical bugs in the avatar system related to custom avatar display, storage management, and UI layout issues. Specifically, it targets issues where custom avatars are not displaying properly despite being successfully stored in Supabase, unnecessary duplication of avatar images on updates, and spacing problems in the avatar group component.

## Goals
- Fix the bug where custom avatars are not displaying in the UI despite successful Supabase storage
- Optimize avatar upload to update existing images rather than creating new ones
- Resolve spacing/overlap issues in the AvatarGroup component
- Improve error handling and debugging capabilities for avatar-related functionality
- Implement fallback mechanism to ensure avatar display in all scenarios

## Technical Approach
The implementation will focus on three main areas:

1. **Avatar Display & Rendering**
   - Investigate why saved avatars are not displaying despite successful storage
   - Check avatar URL construction and path resolution
   - Implement proper cache invalidation for updated avatars
   - Add robust logging for avatar loading/error states
   - Enhance fallback behavior when avatars fail to load

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Modify the avatar upload endpoint to first check for existing avatars
   - Implement a consistent naming convention for avatar files based on user ID
   - Add functionality to delete previous avatars when uploading new ones
   - Optimize image processing to reduce storage needs

3. **Component Layout Fixes**
   - Revise the AvatarGroup component styling with explicit z-index management
   - Implement proper layering for overlapping avatars
   - Use explicit inline styles for consistent spacing between avatars
   - Add browser-specific adjustments for maximum compatibility

The approach prioritizes non-breaking changes and backward compatibility while ensuring that the avatar system is robust and maintainable.

## Related Tasks
- T6_1_AvatarDisplayFix - Fix issues with custom avatars not displaying properly
- T6_2_AvatarStorageOptimization - Optimize avatar storage to prevent duplicate files
- T6_3_AvatarGroupLayoutFix - Resolve spacing and overlap issues in avatar groups

## Timeline & Risks
**Timeline:**
- Investigation phase: 1 day
- Implementation of fixes: 2-3 days
- Testing and validation: 1 day

**Risks:**
- Potential browser-specific rendering issues with avatar groups
- Changes to Supabase storage operations could impact existing avatars
- Cache invalidation might be challenging across different browsers

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Test fixes across multiple browsers and devices
- Implement proper validation and fallback mechanisms
- Add comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Consider a staged rollout approach for storage optimization
