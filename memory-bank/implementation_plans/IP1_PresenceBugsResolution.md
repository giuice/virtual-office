# IP1_PresenceBugsResolution

## Overview
Critical bugs have been identified in the presence system affecting user avatars, space interaction, and realtime updates. This implementation plan outlines the approach to resolve these issues.

## Goals
- Fix missing avatar display in spaces
- Resolve infinite console updates and state management issues
- Fix room click/double-click functionality
- Clean up Socket.io remnants and ensure proper Supabase realtime integration
- Fix space update 404 error

## Technical Approach

### 1. Avatar Display Fix
The avatar display issue appears to be a problem in the data chain:
- API/useUserPresence is not properly mapping avatar URLs from the database
- Need to ensure user avatars are preserved through the presence subscription process
- Enhance error handling and loading states for avatar components

### 2. State Management and Update Loop Fix
Multiple issues contribute to infinite updates:
- 404 errors on /api/spaces/update indicate the endpoint is not properly handling updates
- Debug logs in dom-floor-plan.tsx need optimization
- Supabase realtime subscription needs proper cleanup
- Need to handle PGRST116 error properly when no rows are returned

### 3. Space Interaction Fix
Room click/double-click functionality broken due to:
- Recent removal of space.userIds causing validation failures 
- Need to refactor to use current_space_id consistently
- Update space click handlers to work with new data structure

### 4. Realtime Integration Fix
Socket.io remnants causing connection errors:
- Remove all Socket.io client connection attempts
- Ensure Supabase realtime is properly configured
- Update any remaining socket-dependent code to use Supabase channels

## Related Tasks
- T1_1_AvatarSystem - Fix avatar display and data flow
- T1_2_StateManagement - Resolve infinite updates and 404 errors
- T1_3_SpaceInteraction - Fix room clicking functionality
- T1_4_RealtimeIntegration - Clean up Socket.io and ensure Supabase realtime

## Timeline & Risks
Timeline:
- Priority 1: Fix 404 errors and infinite updates (1-2 days)
- Priority 2: Fix avatar display and space interaction (1-2 days)
- Priority 3: Clean up Socket.io remnants (1 day)

Risks:
- Changes to presence system could temporarily affect all users
- Supabase realtime subscription changes need careful testing
- Space interaction changes need thorough validation
