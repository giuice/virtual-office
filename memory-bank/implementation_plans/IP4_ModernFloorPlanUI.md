# IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI

## Overview
Redesign and implement a modern, elegant, and cozy floor plan UI for the virtual office application. This plan focuses on enhancing the visual appeal, user experience, and overall aesthetic of the floor plan component while ensuring it remains functional and performant.
**IMPORTANT**: it's tailwind 4 Consult `tailwind-upgrade-guide.md` for more info

## Goals
- Create a visually appealing, modern UI for the floor plan
- Implement a cozy and elegant design aesthetic
- Improve user experience when navigating and interacting with spaces
- Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Replace any remaining Konva dependencies with pure React/DOM implementations
- Optimize performance for smooth interactions

## Technical Approach
We will redesign the floor plan UI using a combination of Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI components, and potentially additional animations. The implementation will be based on a "DOM-first" approach, leveraging React components and CSS rather than canvas-based solutions like Konva.

The redesign will include:
1. Enhanced space representation with better visual hierarchy
2. Improved avatar display and interaction within spaces
3. Modern visual indicators for space status, occupancy, and type
4. Smooth transitions and animations for state changes
5. Better visual feedback for user interactions

We'll ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality while introducing new design elements. The implementation will follow a component-based approach, creating reusable UI elements that can be composed to form the complete floor plan.
