# T4_3_FloorPlanLayout Instructions

## Objective
Redesign the overall floor plan layout to create a more elegant, visually organized, and intuitive arrangement of spaces.

## Context
[Implementation Plan: IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI]
The current floor plan uses a basic grid layout. This task will enhance the visual arrangement of spaces, improving the overall floor plan structure to create a more appealing, office-like layout that feels cozy while maintaining clarity and usability.

## Dependencies
- T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem (Design guidelines)
- T4_2_SpaceCardComponent (Space card implementation)
- src/components/floor-plan/dom-floor-plan.tsx (Current implementation)
- src/contexts/PresenceContext.tsx (For user presence data)

## Steps
1. Analyze the current layout implementation:
   - Review the DOM-based floor plan structure
   - Identify limitations and areas for improvement
   - Document current layout logic and responsive behavior

2. Design the new layout structure:
   - Create a more office-like layout with visual sections
   - Define layout grid or arrangement logic
   - Plan room grouping by type or function
   - Design empty states and loading indicators

3. Implement the modernized floor plan container:
   - Update container styling and structure
   - Implement improved background and borders
   - Add visual depth with subtle shadows or effects
   - Create "zones" or sections if appropriate

4. Implement the spaces arrangement logic:
   - Update the grid or flex-based layout
   - Implement proper spacing and alignment
   - Add visual grouping for related spaces
   - Ensure proper distribution of space cards

5. Add layout enhancements:
   - Create a header/control section for filters or tools
   - Add visual cues for navigation
   - Implement floor labels or section dividers if needed
   - Design and implement a mini-map if appropriate

6. Optimize the layout for different screen sizes:
   - Update responsive behavior
   - Implement layout adjustments for mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Ensure spaces remain accessible on smaller screens
   - Test and refine breakpoints

7. Implement scroll and navigation enhancements:
   - Add smooth scrolling behavior
   - Improve scroll containers and overflow handling
   - Implement scroll to space/section if needed
   - Add keyboard navigation support

8. Integrate with presence system:
   - Ensure proper rendering of user presence
   - Update the layout when users enter/exit spaces
   - Maintain performance during presence updates

## Expected Output
- A redesigned floor plan component that:
  - Presents spaces in a visually appealing, office-like arrangement
  - Groups and organizes spaces in an intuitive way
  - Provides better visual hierarchy and navigation
  - Adapts fluidly to different screen sizes
  - Maintains all existing functionality while enhancing the user experience
  - Follows the design system established in earlier tasks
