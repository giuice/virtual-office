## Objective
Add purposeful, performant animations and transitions across the modern floor plan, respecting reduced motion.

## Context
[Implementation Plan: IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI_v2]

## Dependencies

## Steps
1. Define motion tokens: durations, easings, stagger strategies.
2. Implement SpaceCard hover/selection/enter/exit transitions using transforms/opacity.
3. Add layout change transitions for filtering/sorting.
4. Implement presence join/leave micro-animations for avatars.
5. Add reduced-motion checks and fallbacks.

## Expected Output
