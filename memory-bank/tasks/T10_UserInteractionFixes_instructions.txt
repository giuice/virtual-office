# T10_UserInteractionFixes Instructions

## Objective
Fix user-to-user messaging and interaction in the floor plan to enable proper communication between users.

## Context
Users are unable to send messages to other users when clicking on them in the floor plan. This is a core functionality of the virtual office that needs to be fixed urgently.

[Implementation Plan: IP1_MessagingConversationsFixes]

## Dependencies
- src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlan.tsx
- src/components/messaging/MessageDialog.tsx
- src/components/messaging/MessageInput.tsx
- src/hooks/useConversations.ts
- src/hooks/useMessages.ts
- src/lib/messaging-api.ts
- src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx

## Steps
1. **Fix User Click Interactions**
   - Examine how user clicks on the floor plan are handled
   - Ensure clicking on another user opens the correct messaging dialog
   - Debug event propagation and click handlers in floor plan components
   - Fix any issues with user identification or conversation routing

2. **Fix Conversation Initialization**
   - Debug conversation creation when sending message to a user
   - Ensure conversations are properly created if they don't exist
   - Fix any issues with participant identification
   - Address any UUID vs UID format issues in conversation participant handling

3. **Update Messaging Dialog Components**
   - Ensure proper opening/closing of messaging dialogs on user interaction
   - Fix display of recipient information in messaging UI
   - Update component state handling for message threads
   - Verify message routing based on selected recipient

4. **Fix Real-time Message Delivery**
   - Ensure messages are properly delivered in real-time
   - Fix any issues with subscription to message events
   - Ensure message notifications appear correctly
   - Debug Socket.IO or Supabase Realtime connection for messaging

5. **Add User Presence Indicators**
   - Add clear visual indicators for online users
   - Update user status in real-time across sessions
   - Ensure user avatars reflect current online status

## Expected Output
- Ability to click on other users and send messages to them
- Proper conversation initialization for new user interactions
- Messaging dialogs that correctly show the intended recipient
- Real-time message delivery between users

## Notes
- Focus on the core interaction path of clicking a user and sending a message
- Prioritize fixing the immediate user-to-user communication flow
- Consider adding temporary UI elements to make interaction points more obvious
- Be mindful of the Firebase UID vs Database UUID mismatch when handling participants
