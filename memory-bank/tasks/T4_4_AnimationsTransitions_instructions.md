# T4_4_AnimationsTransitions Instructions

## Objective
Add smooth, elegant animations and transitions to the floor plan UI to enhance the visual experience and provide better feedback for user interactions.

## Context
[Implementation Plan: IP4_ModernFloorPlanUI]
A modern UI requires thoughtful animations and transitions to feel polished and responsive. This task focuses on implementing subtle but effective motion design to enhance the floor plan's cozy and elegant feel while providing visual feedback for user actions.

## Dependencies
- T4_1_SpaceDesignSystem (Design guidelines)
- T4_2_SpaceCardComponent (Space card component)
- T4_3_FloorPlanLayout (Overall floor plan layout)
- tailwind.config.js (For animation configurations)

## Steps
1. Identify animation opportunities:
   - List all interactive elements that need animation
   - Identify state changes that should be animated
   - Document transitions between views or modes
   - Note loading states and data fetching scenarios

2. Design animation principles and standards:
   - Define timing functions and durations
   - Establish motion patterns (expand, fade, slide, etc.)
   - Create rules for coordinated animations
   - Decide on animation triggers (hover, click, data change)

3. Implement space card animations:
   - Add hover and focus animations
   - Create animations for selection/deselection
   - Implement entry and exit animations
   - Add user join/leave animations

4. Add transitions for layout changes:
   - Implement smooth layout shifts
   - Add transitions for filtering or sorting
   - Create animations for resizing or rearranging
   - Implement loading state transitions

5. Enhance user feedback animations:
   - Add click/tap feedback effects
   - Implement error or warning animations
   - Create success indicators for actions
   - Add subtle idle animations for engagement

6. Optimize animation performance:
   - Use CSS transforms and opacity for better performance
   - Implement will-change for elements that animate frequently
   - Add animation toggling based on reduced motion preferences
   - Test performance on various devices

7. Implement animation utilities:
   - Create reusable animation components or hooks
   - Add animation control functions
   - Implement sequenced or chained animations
   - Create animation variants for different contexts

8. Ensure accessibility:
   - Respect user preferences for reduced motion
   - Ensure animations don't interfere with usability
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes for animated elements

## Expected Output
- A set of smooth, purposeful animations and transitions that:
  - Enhance the visual experience without being distracting
  - Provide clear feedback for user interactions
  - Make state changes more understandable
  - Create a sense of polish and refinement in the UI
  - Respect accessibility considerations
  - Maintain good performance across devices
