# T8_FloorPlanVisibilityFixes Instructions

## Objective
Fix floor plan visualization issues including black spaces, missing spaces, and user avatar display across different sessions.

## Context
Users are experiencing issues with the floor plan visualization where spaces appear black, only one space is visible despite multiple being created, and users from other sessions are not appearing on the floor plan.

[Implementation Plan: IP1_MessagingConversationsFixes]

## Dependencies
- src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlan.tsx
- src/components/floor-plan/Space.tsx (if exists)
- src/hooks/useSpaces.ts
- src/contexts/CompanyContext.tsx (for user data)
- src/hooks/useUsers.ts (if exists)

## Steps
1. **Analyze Floor Plan Rendering**
   - Examine the FloorPlan component to understand how spaces are rendered
   - Check for styling issues that might be causing spaces to appear black
   - Verify that space data is being correctly loaded and passed to components

2. **Fix Space Visibility**
   - Add proper styling for spaces, ensuring they have visible borders and background colors
   - Add visual indicators showing which space the user is currently in
   - Add name/label display for spaces on the floor plan

3. **Fix Space Loading**
   - Debug the space loading logic to ensure all spaces are properly fetched
   - Verify React Query hooks are working correctly for space data
   - Fix any issues with space data filtering or rendering conditions

4. **Ensure User Avatars Display Correctly**
   - Add or fix user avatar components in the floor plan
   - Ensure real-time updates for user positions are working
   - Implement proper Supabase Realtime subscriptions for user presence

5. **Add Debugging Tools**
   - Add temporary visual debugging information to spaces/rooms
   - Add console logging for space data loading and rendering
   - Add state displays for currently loaded spaces

## Expected Output
- All created spaces visible on floor plan with proper styling
- Clear visual indication of which space the user is currently in
- User avatars correctly displayed and updated in real time
- Spaces properly labeled with names/identifiers

## Notes
- Focus on minimal changes needed to restore basic functionality
- Prioritize fixing the "black space" issue first as it's most critical for usability
- Consider adding temporary bright colors to spaces for debugging purposes
- The investigation into users appearing in incorrect spaces (like 'Cozinha') concluded on 2025-04-05.
- The root cause was identified as incorrect data mapping (`userIds` handling) in `SupabaseSpaceRepository.ts` (addressed in prior steps).
- Verification was done by adding logging to `CompanyContext.tsx`, confirming the correct data is now fetched and stored.
- This specific aspect of floor plan visibility related to incorrect user assignments is considered resolved.
