# Operation Clean Slate: A Robust Refactor of the Messaging System

## 1. Introduction & Goal

**Problem:** Recent attempts to fix bugs in the messaging system have failed, indicating a likely architectural problem. The current implementation is complex, leading to unpredictable behavior like failed message delivery and UI navigation bugs.

**Goal:** To refactor the messaging system from the ground up, focusing on simplicity, stability, and modern best practices. The end result will be a reliable, real-time messaging experience.

**Audience:** This plan is designed for a junior developer. Each step includes not just *what* to do, but *why* we are doing it.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, clear code over complex solutions.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each hook and component should have one single, clear responsibility.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The React Query cache will be the definitive source of truth for all message data on the client.
*   **Documentation First:** All implementation will be based on the latest official documentation.

---

## 3. Phase 1: Research and Foundation (The "Right Way")

*In this phase, we will not touch the existing messaging code. The goal is to prove our core technologies work correctly in isolation.*

### Task 1.1: Fetch Latest Supabase Realtime Documentation

*   **Why:** We must ensure we are using the most current, official patterns for Supabase Realtime with React and the Next.js App Router. This avoids building on top of outdated examples.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Use the **Context7** tool to query for the latest Supabase documentation.
    2.  Search for topics like: `Supabase Realtime`, `supabase-js v2 realtime`, `Next.js App Router realtime subscription`.
    3.  Save the key examples and documentation snippets into a temporary file for reference.

### Task 1.2: Isolate and Verify Realtime in a Test Environment

*   **Why:** To confirm that we can successfully receive realtime events from Supabase in a clean environment, completely separate from the existing application's complexity. This is a critical sanity check.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Create a new, temporary test page: `/app/(dashboard)/realtime-test/page.tsx`.
    2.  Create a new, dedicated test hook: `/src/hooks/realtime/useRealtimeTest.ts`.
    3.  In `useRealtimeTest.ts`, write the simplest possible code to connect to Supabase and subscribe to database changes on a specific table (e.g., the `messages` table).
    4.  When an event is received, simply log it to the browser console: `console.log('Realtime event received:', payload)`.
    5.  In the `realtime-test` page, use this hook and render a simple message like "Testing realtime connection... Check the console."
    6.  Manually change data in your Supabase table and confirm the event is logged in the browser.

### Task 1.3: Solidify the `create-message` API Endpoint

*   **Why:** The API endpoint is the gateway for all new messages. It must be simple, secure, and reliable.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Review the code at `/src/app/api/messages/create/route.ts`.
    2.  Ensure it strictly follows this logic:
        *   It uses the **server-side** Supabase client: `createSupabaseServerClient()`.
        *   It authenticates the user and finds their database profile ID (`users.id`).
        *   It validates that `conversationId` and `content` are present.
        *   It creates the message in the database using the user's **database ID**, not their Supabase Auth UID.
        *   It returns the newly created message object on success.

## 4. Phase 2: Rebuild the Messaging Core Hooks

*With a proven foundation, we will now build a new, clean set of hooks for messaging.*

### Task 2.1: Create a New, Dedicated Subscription Hook

*   **Why:** To separate the responsibility of *listening for realtime events* from the responsibility of *fetching historical data*. This is a core principle of clean architecture.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Create a new file: `/src/hooks/realtime/useMessageSubscription.ts`.
    2.  Using the successful pattern from `useRealtimeTest.ts`, create a hook that accepts a `conversationId`.
    3.  This hook will subscribe to `postgres_changes` on the `messages` table, filtered for the specific `conversationId`.
    4.  When a new message event is received, use the `queryClient` from React Query to optimistically add the new message to the cache. The key for the cache should be `['messages', conversationId]`. Use `queryClient.setQueryData`.

### Task 2.2: Refactor `useMessages.ts` for Simplicity

*   **Why:** This hook's only job should be to fetch paginated message history. All realtime logic will be handled by our new `useMessageSubscription` hook.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Go to `/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`.
    2.  Remove **all** existing realtime subscription logic from this file.
    3.  Ensure the `useInfiniteQuery` is correctly configured to fetch pages of messages for a given `conversationId`.
    4.  In the component where messages are displayed, you will now call **both** `useMessages(...)` and `useMessageSubscription(...)`.

### Task 2.3: Refactor the Message Sending Logic

*   **Why:** The UI needs a clean and predictable way to send a message and see it appear instantly.
*   **Action:**
    1.  In the component used for writing and sending messages (e.g., `MessageInput`), locate the `onSubmit` or `handleSend` function.
    2.  This function should use the `useMutation` hook from React Query.
    3.  The `mutationFn` will call our robust `/api/messages/create` endpoint.
    4.  Implement the `onMutate` function for an optimistic update:
        *   Cancel any outgoing refetches.
        *   Get the current message list from the query cache.
        *   Add the new, temporary message to the list.
        *   Update the query cache with the new list using `queryClient.setQueryData`.

## 5. Phase 3: Fix UI Interactions Systematically

*Instead of patching, we will implement a clear, reusable pattern for handling clicks on nested interactive elements.*

### Task 3.1: Implement a Systematic Event-Stopping Strategy

*   **Why:** The "teleporting" bug is caused by a click event on a child element (the avatar) "bubbling up" to a parent element (the space card) and triggering its `onClick` handler. We need a reliable way to stop this.
*   **Action:**
    1.  The chosen strategy is using a `data-attribute`.
    2.  In `InteractiveUserAvatar.tsx`, ensure the main clickable element (the `<button>`) has the attribute `data-avatar-interactive="true"`.
    3.  In `ModernSpaceCard.tsx`, update the `onClick` handler:
        *   It should check if the click event's target (or any of its parents) has the `data-avatar-interactive="true"` attribute. A good way to do this is `(e.target as HTMLElement).closest('[data-avatar-interactive="true"]')`.
        *   If it does, call `e.stopPropagation()` immediately and `return` from the handler. This prevents the card's navigation logic from ever running.

---

## 6. Deprecation and Cleanup

*   **Why:** To prevent future confusion and ensure that old, broken code is not accidentally reused, we must formally deprecate and remove it. This is a critical step for long-term maintainability.
*   **Action:** After all phases above are complete and verified, the following files and hooks should be considered for deprecation or removal.
    *   **`src/hooks/realtime/useMessageRealtime.ts`**: This hook's logic will be replaced by the new `useMessageSubscription.ts`. It should be deleted.
    *   **`src/hooks/realtime/useRealtimeTest.ts`**: This was a temporary file for verification. It should be deleted.
    *   **`/app/(dashboard)/realtime-test/page.tsx`**: The temporary test page. It should be deleted.
    *   **Old Messaging-related Hooks (if any)**: Any other hooks that were part of the old, broken implementation should be identified and removed.
*   **Final Step:** After deleting the files, run a global search for their names to ensure no import statements are left dangling.

---

## 7. Final Verification

*   **Why:** To confirm all pieces work together as expected and that the old code has been successfully removed.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Verify that clicking "Send Message" on an avatar no longer teleports you.
    2.  Verify that when you send a message, it appears instantly in your chat window (optimistic update).
    3.  Open a second browser window logged in as the recipient. Verify the message appears in their chat window in real-time.
    4.  Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` to ensure the project is clean after file removals.
