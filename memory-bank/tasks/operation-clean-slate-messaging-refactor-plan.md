# Operation Clean Slate: A Robust Refactor of the Messaging System

## 1. Introduction & Goal

**Problem:** Recent attempts to fix bugs in the messaging system have failed, indicating a likely architectural problem. The current implementation is complex, leading to unpredictable behavior like failed message delivery and UI navigation bugs.

**Goal:** To refactor the messaging system from the ground up, focusing on simplicity, stability, and modern best practices. The end result will be a reliable, real-time messaging experience.

**Audience:** This plan is designed for a junior developer. Each step includes not just *what* to do, but *why* we are doing it.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, clear code over complex solutions.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each hook and component should have one single, clear responsibility.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The React Query cache will be the definitive source of truth for all message data on the client.
*   **Documentation First:** All implementation will be based on the latest official documentation.

---

## Data Structure Insights (from existing tables)

*   **Why:** Analyzing the existing database schema helps us understand the original design intent and avoid repeating past mistakes. These insights should guide our new implementation.
*   **Key Findings:**
    1.  **User ID Consistency is Critical:** The `messages` table has a `sender_id` (uuid) which links to the `users` table, not the `auth.users` table. This confirms our plan to standardize on using the internal database user ID (`users.id`) for all application logic is the correct approach.
    2.  **Handle System Messages:** The `sender_id` on the `messages` table is nullable. This is a strong indicator that the system is designed to handle messages without a user sender, such as "User X has joined the room." Our new UI must gracefully handle these `null` sender IDs, likely by rendering a special system message format instead of a user avatar.
    3.  **Use the `unread_count` Column:** The `conversations` table has an `unread_count` column of type `jsonb`. This is an efficient design that likely stores per-user counts (e.g., `{"user_id_1": 5, "user_id_2": 0}`). We should **not** try to calculate unread counts with expensive queries. Instead, our backend logic should focus on correctly incrementing/decrementing the values within this JSON object when a message is read.

---

## 3. Phase 1: Research and Foundation (The "Right Way")

*In this phase, we will not touch the existing messaging code. The goal is to prove our core technologies work correctly in isolation.*

### Task 1.1: Fetch Latest Supabase Realtime Documentation

*   **Why:** We must ensure we are using the most current, official patterns for Supabase Realtime with React and the Next.js App Router. This avoids building on top of outdated examples.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Use the **Context7** tool to query for the latest Supabase documentation.
    2.  Search for topics like: `Supabase Realtime`, `supabase-js v2 realtime`, `Next.js App Router realtime subscription`.
    3.  Update this document  the key examples and documentation snippets into a section called {## Updated References}
	4. Check this Task as completed and Updated this document with all info that next dev will get the task can follow with our planning without problems. You can create a Section named {## Findings and Learned }
  **Status: Completed**

## Updated References

### Subscribing to Realtime Changes in a Next.js Client Component

This is the core pattern for receiving realtime updates in the browser.

```tsx
'use client'

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import supabase from '../../utils/supabase' // Note: We will use our browser client

export default function RealtimePosts({ serverPosts }: { serverPosts: any }) {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState(serverPosts)

  useEffect(() => {
    setPosts(serverPosts)
  }, [serverPosts])

  useEffect(() => {
    const channel = supabase
      .channel('*')
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'posts' }, (payload) =>
        setPosts((posts: any) => [...posts, payload.new])
      )
      .subscribe()

    return () => {
      supabase.removeChannel(channel)
    }
  }, [serverPosts])

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

### General Realtime Subscription Syntax

The `postgres_changes` event is the modern way to listen for database changes.

```typescript
const userListener = supabase
  .channel('public:user')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'user' }, (payload) =>
    handleAllEventsPayload()
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Middleware for Session Management

Ensuring the user's session is refreshed is critical for Server Components and authenticated requests.

```typescript
import { createMiddlewareClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const res = NextResponse.next()

  // Create a Supabase client configured to use cookies
  const supabase = createMiddlewareClient({ req, res })

  // Refresh session if expired - required for Server Components
  await supabase.auth.getSession()

  return res
}
```

## Findings and Learned

1.  **Use `postgres_changes`:** The modern API for listening to database changes is via `channel.on('postgres_changes', ...)`. This is a key change from older Supabase examples and is what we must use.
2.  **Client-Side Subscriptions:** Realtime subscriptions are managed in Client Components (`'use client'`) using `useEffect` to handle setup and cleanup. This is the correct pattern for the Next.js App Router.
3.  **Channel Cleanup is Essential:** The `useEffect` hook must return a cleanup function that calls `supabase.removeChannel(channel)`. Forgetting this will lead to memory leaks and multiple unnecessary connections.
4.  **Initial Data from Server, Updates on Client:** The recommended pattern is to fetch the initial dataset in a Server Component and pass it as props to a Client Component. The Client Component then subscribes to *new* events (like `INSERT`) and updates its local state. This provides a fast initial page load and a responsive UI.
5.  **Auth Helpers are Key:** The `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` (or the newer `@supabase/ssr`) package is not optional. The middleware is required to correctly manage auth state across the application, especially for server-side rendering and API routes. Our API endpoint for creating messages *must* use the server-side client that respects this auth flow.


## Functional Spec — Conversations & Messages

This is the ground truth for how conversations and messages must behave, like a standard chat app (WhatsApp/iMessage/Slack DM + group rooms). Build and test against this spec.

### Conversations

* **Types:** Use `ConversationType` from `src/types/messaging.ts`
  - `DIRECT`: exactly 2 participants (1-to-1 chat).
  - `ROOM`: a room/space-based group conversation. `roomId` present.
  - `GROUP`: optional multi-user group (not bound to a room) — keep API compatible but focus on `DIRECT` and `ROOM` first.
* **Participants:** Array of database user IDs (`users.id`), never Supabase Auth UIDs.
* **Sorting:** Conversation list sorted by `lastActivity` DESC (most recent at top).
* **Unread Count:** `unread_count` (jsonb) stores per-user unread message counts by database user ID. Backend updates counts on INSERT/READ; client reads and displays without recalculation.
* **Archiving:** Archiving is per-user; archived conversations stay fetchable if `includeArchived=true`.

### Messages

* **Ownership:** Each message belongs to exactly one conversation (`conversationId`).
* **Sender:** `senderId` is the database user ID or `null` for system messages (e.g., “X joined the room”). UI must render system messages without avatar.
* **Display Order:** For rendering, messages are displayed oldest → newest (ascending by `timestamp`) and the view is scrolled to the bottom.
* **Initial Load (required fix):** The initial fetch must load the last N messages (the most recent window), not the first N from the beginning of history. This ensures users see recent context immediately.
* **Pagination Strategy (keyset by timestamp):**
  - `initial`: select last N by `ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT N`, then client reverses to ascending before render.
  - `older`: provide `cursorBefore` = oldest visible `timestamp`; server returns messages with `timestamp < cursorBefore` via `ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT N`; client reverses and prepends.
  - `newer` (optional): provide `cursorAfter` = latest visible `timestamp`; server returns messages with `timestamp > cursorAfter` via `ORDER BY timestamp ASC LIMIT N`; client appends.
* **Realtime:** Subscribe to `INSERT` on `messages` filtered by `conversation_id = activeConversationId`. On insert, append to cache if not already present (handle optimistic insert replacement). Support `UPDATE` (content/status edits) and `DELETE` (remove) as a follow-up.
* **Attachments/Reactions:** Present but non-blocking for core messaging. Reactions are additive; attachments load with each message.
* **Timestamps:** API returns ISO strings; client normalizes to `Date` objects at the query layer before caching as `Message.timestamp: Date`.

### UX Guarantees

* Show last N messages on open and auto-scroll to bottom.
* Preserve scroll position when older messages are prepended.
* New incoming messages should appear in real-time without a full refetch.
* System messages show a distinct, icon-only style.

---

## Immediate Fix — “Historical Messages Not Visible”

Observed: Messages save to DB but the client does not show previously sent messages on open. Root cause is almost always initial windowing and/or sort direction.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Opening any conversation shows the most recent messages immediately.
* Scrolling up loads older messages in chunks without reordering the existing list.
* Sending a message appends it in the view instantly (optimistic), then confirms via realtime or API response.

### Backend Contract (target shape)

Endpoint: `GET /api/messages/get`

Query params:
* `conversationId` (required)
* `limit` (default 20; max 100)
* `cursorBefore` (ISO string timestamp) — for loading older messages
* `cursorAfter` (ISO string timestamp) — optional for loading newer messages

Response:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "conversationId": "...",
      "senderId": "... | null",
      "content": "...",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-11T12:34:56.000Z",
      "type": "text|image|file|system|announcement",
      "status": "sent|delivered|read",
      "replyToId": "... | null",
      "attachments": [...],
      "reactions": [...],
      "isEdited": false
    }
  ],
  "nextCursorBefore": "2025-09-10T12:00:00.000Z",
  "hasMoreOlder": true
}
```

Notes:
* For `initial` page, server returns the last N rows using `ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT N`, then the client reverses to ascending.
* For `older`, server uses `WHERE timestamp < cursorBefore ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT N`.
* If maintaining the existing offset-based approach temporarily, the server must still emulate “last N” for initial by computing total count or querying DESC and reversing. Prefer keyset pagination for reliability and performance.

### Client Integration (TanStack Query)

* Query key: `['messages', conversationId]`.
* `useInfiniteQuery` uses `nextCursorBefore` as `getNextPageParam` and prepends pages when fetching older.
* Normalize timestamps to `Date` immediately after fetch before writing into cache.
* Keep realtime strictly in a dedicated hook that only writes to the cache (`useMessageSubscription`).

### Action Plan (incremental, safe)

1. API route: extend `/src/app/api/messages/get/route.ts` to accept `cursorBefore`/`cursorAfter` and implement the “initial last-N” behavior. Keep compatibility with `limit`.
2. Repository: add query paths that support DESC + `lt/gt` timestamp filters (keyset). Keep existing method for now, but prefer timestamp keyset when cursors are provided.
3. Client API: update `messagingApi.getMessages(...)` to pass `cursorBefore` for older loads and parse ISO timestamps into `Date` objects before returning `Message[]`.
4. Hook: refactor `useMessages` to initialize by fetching the last N and reversing to ascending; use `getNextPageParam` = `nextCursorBefore`; when fetching older, prepend the new page.
5. UI: on mount of a conversation, auto-scroll to bottom; when older pages load, preserve scroll position.


### Task 1.2: Isolate and Verify Realtime in a Test Environment

*   **Why:** To confirm that we can successfully receive realtime events from Supabase in a clean environment, completely separate from the existing application's complexity. This is a critical sanity check.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Create a new, temporary test page: `/app/(dashboard)/realtime-test/page.tsx`.
    2.  Create a new, dedicated test hook: `/src/hooks/realtime/useRealtimeTest.ts`.
    3.  In `useRealtimeTest.ts`, write the simplest possible code to connect to Supabase and subscribe to database changes on a specific table (e.g., the `messages` table).
    4.  When an event is received, simply log it to the browser console: `console.log('Realtime event received:', payload)`.
    5.  In the `realtime-test` page, use this hook and render a simple message like "Testing realtime connection... Check the console."
    6.  Manually change data in your Supabase table and confirm the event is logged in the browser.

### Task 1.4: Hotfix — Show Existing Messages on Open

*   **Why:** Users must see past conversation context immediately; currently missing.
*   **Action:**
  1.  Update `GET /api/messages/get` to support `cursorBefore` and “initial last-N” response.
  2.  Update `messagingApi.getMessages` to send `cursorBefore` and normalize timestamps to `Date`.
  3.  Update `useMessages` initial query to reverse the initial page to ascending and wire `getNextPageParam` to `nextCursorBefore` (older paging).
  4.  Verify against a conversation with existing messages — ensure last messages render on open.

### Task 1.3: Solidify the `create-message` API Endpoint

*   **Why:** The API endpoint is the gateway for all new messages. It must be simple, secure, and reliable.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Review the code at `/src/app/api/messages/create/route.ts`.
    2.  Ensure it strictly follows this logic:
        *   It uses the **server-side** Supabase client: `createSupabaseServerClient()`.
        *   It authenticates the user and finds their database profile ID (`users.id`).
        *   It validates that `conversationId` and `content` are present.
        *   It creates the message in the database using the user's **database ID**, not their Supabase Auth UID.
        *   It returns the newly created message object on success.

## 4. Phase 2: Rebuild the Messaging Core Hooks

*With a proven foundation, we will now build a new, clean set of hooks for messaging.*

### Task 2.1: Create a New, Dedicated Subscription Hook

*   **Why:** To separate the responsibility of *listening for realtime events* from the responsibility of *fetching historical data*. This is a core principle of clean architecture.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Create a new file: `/src/hooks/realtime/useMessageSubscription.ts`.
    2.  Using the successful pattern from `useRealtimeTest.ts`, create a hook that accepts a `conversationId`.
    3.  This hook will subscribe to `postgres_changes` on the `messages` table, filtered for the specific `conversationId`.
  4.  When a new message event is received, use the `queryClient` from React Query to optimistically add the new message to the cache. The key for the cache should be `['messages', conversationId]`. Use `queryClient.setQueryData`.
  5.  Ignore duplicates: guard by message `id` to prevent double-inserts when optimistic entries are later confirmed by realtime.

### Task 2.2: Refactor `useMessages.ts` for Simplicity

*   **Why:** This hook's only job should be to fetch paginated message history. All realtime logic will be handled by our new `useMessageSubscription` hook.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Go to `/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`.
    2.  Remove **all** existing realtime subscription logic from this file.
    3.  Ensure the `useInfiniteQuery` is correctly configured to fetch pages of messages for a given `conversationId`.
  4.  In the component where messages are displayed, you will now call **both** `useMessages(...)` and `useMessageSubscription(...)`.
  5.  Ensure paging behavior matches the spec: reverse initial “last-N” page for ascending display; when fetching older, prepend.

### Task 2.3: Refactor the Message Sending Logic

*   **Why:** The UI needs a clean and predictable way to send a message and see it appear instantly.
*   **Action:**
    1.  In the component used for writing and sending messages (e.g., `MessageInput`), locate the `onSubmit` or `handleSend` function.
    2.  This function should use the `useMutation` hook from React Query.
    3.  The `mutationFn` will call our robust `/api/messages/create` endpoint.
    4.  Implement the `onMutate` function for an optimistic update:
        *   Cancel any outgoing refetches.
        *   Get the current message list from the query cache.
        *   Add the new, temporary message to the list.
  *   Update the query cache with the new list using `queryClient.setQueryData`.
  *   When the server responds or realtime confirms, replace the optimistic message by `id` match.

### Task 2.4: Incoming Message Notifications (Recipient Alerts)

*   **Why:** Currently recipients receive no alert when a message arrives. We need a clear, non-intrusive attention mechanism.
*   **Action:**
  1.  Reuse `useConversationRealtime(currentUserProfile?.id)` to receive `conversations` UPDATE events. On each payload, compare `unread_count[currentUserProfile.id]` between previous cache and `payload.new`.
  2.  If unread increased and the affected conversation is NOT the `activeConversation`, trigger a toast using `useNotification` (from `src/hooks/useNotification.ts`).
    - Toast content: conversation name (room) or other user’s display name; preview last message content if available.
    - Toast click: navigate/select that conversation and mark as read.
  3.  Optional desktop notifications when tab is unfocused:
    - On first use, request Notification API permission.
    - If granted and document not focused, display a `new Notification(title, { body })` with click handler to focus and open the conversation.
  4.  Unread badges: rely on `useConversations` `unreadCount` map to render per-conversation badges and a total badge. No client-side recounting; backend maintains counts.
  5.  Policy: Do NOT auto-open threads on message arrival to avoid disruptive navigation. Use toasts/desktop notifications and badges instead. Consider a future user setting for auto-open.
*   **Acceptance:**
  - Recipient sees a toast on new message arrival if not already viewing that conversation.
  - Unread badge increments immediately without refresh.
  - Clicking the toast opens that conversation and clears the count for that user.
  - If viewing the conversation and window is focused, no toast is shown.
  - If the tab is backgrounded and permission granted, a desktop notification appears.

---

## 5. Phase 3: Fix UI Interactions Systematically

*Instead of patching, we will implement a clear, reusable pattern for handling clicks on nested interactive elements.*

### Task 3.1: Implement a Systematic Event-Stopping Strategy

*   **Why:** The "teleporting" bug is caused by a click event on a child element (the avatar) "bubbling up" to a parent element (the space card) and triggering its `onClick` handler. We need a reliable way to stop this.
*   **Action:**
    1.  The chosen strategy is using a `data-attribute`.
    2.  In `InteractiveUserAvatar.tsx`, ensure the main clickable element (the `<button>`) has the attribute `data-avatar-interactive="true"`.
    3.  In `ModernSpaceCard.tsx`, update the `onClick` handler:
        *   It should check if the click event's target (or any of its parents) has the `data-avatar-interactive="true"` attribute. A good way to do this is `(e.target as HTMLElement).closest('[data-avatar-interactive="true"]')`.
        *   If it does, call `e.stopPropagation()` immediately and `return` from the handler. This prevents the card's navigation logic from ever running.

---

## 6. Deprecation and Cleanup

*   **Why:** To prevent future confusion and ensure that old, broken code is not accidentally reused, we must formally deprecate and remove it. This is a critical step for long-term maintainability.
*   **Action:** After all phases above are complete and verified, the following files and hooks should be considered for deprecation or removal.
    *   **`src/hooks/realtime/useMessageRealtime.ts`**: This hook's logic will be replaced by the new `useMessageSubscription.ts`. It should be deleted.
    *   **`src/hooks/realtime/useRealtimeTest.ts`**: This was a temporary file for verification. It should be deleted.
    *   **`/app/(dashboard)/realtime-test/page.tsx`**: The temporary test page. It should be deleted.
    *   **Old Messaging-related Hooks (if any)**: Any other hooks that were part of the old, broken implementation should be identified and removed.
*   **Final Step:** After deleting the files, run a global search for their names to ensure no import statements are left dangling.

---

## 7. Final Verification

*   **Why:** To confirm all pieces work together as expected and that the old code has been successfully removed.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Verify that clicking "Send Message" on an avatar no longer teleports you.
    2.  Verify that when you send a message, it appears instantly in your chat window (optimistic update).
    3.  Open a second browser window logged in as the recipient. Verify the message appears in their chat window in real-time.
  4.  Verify that the recipient receives a toast (and desktop notification if enabled) when the conversation is not active; clicking it opens the conversation and clears unread.
  5.  Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` to ensure the project is clean after file removals.
