# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Virtual Office application currently has critical issues preventing proper testing and user experience. Users cannot properly sign up/sign in with multiple accounts, there's no user invitation system, and the layout is broken. Additionally, the current styling system needs to be enhanced with improved theming, color schemes, and layout consistency using the existing Shadcn/TailwindCSS foundation. These foundational issues must be resolved to enable proper avatar testing and overall application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I sign out of the application THEN I SHALL be able to sign in with a different Google account
2. WHEN I sign up with a new Google account THEN the system SHALL create a new user profile without conflicts
3. WHEN multiple users are signed in from different browsers/devices THEN each user SHALL have their own independent session
4. WHEN I clear browser data and sign in again THEN the system SHALL properly authenticate without errors
5. IF there are authentication conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

5. IF an invitation expires THEN the system SHALL prevent its use and allow generating a new invitation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application layout to be visually consistent and properly styled, so that I have a pleasant and professional user experience.

5. IF there are layout issues THEN they SHALL be fixed using DaisyUI components and utilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance the existing Shadcn/TailwindCSS theming system with improved color schemes and design consistency, so that the application has a modern and cohesive visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I use themed components THEN they SHALL provide consistent styling and color schemes across the application
3. WHEN I apply custom theme variables THEN they SHALL enhance the visual hierarchy and user experience
4. WHEN existing Shadcn components are enhanced THEN they SHALL maintain their functionality while improving their appearance
5. IF there are styling inconsistencies THEN they SHALL be resolved using TailwindCSS custom properties and CSS variables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and user feedback during authentication, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN I'm in the middle of an authentication flow THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading states
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN I SHALL be redirected to the appropriate page based on my user state

### Requirement 6
