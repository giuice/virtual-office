# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Virtual Office App

## App Overview
The virtual office app is a digital workspace designed to enhance collaboration for remote and hybrid teams by simulating a physical office environment. It provides an interactive, user-friendly platform for seamless connection, communication, and collaboration. Key features include an interactive virtual office layout with configurable spaces (rooms), user avatars with status indicators, real-time messaging, meeting tools, and administrative controls. The design leverages TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI for a modern, approachable interface.

**Target Audience:** Remote workers, hybrid teams, and organizations seeking efficient digital collaboration tools.

## Database & Data Storage
The database is crucial for supporting real-time features, user management, space configuration, messaging, and AI capabilities. It ensures data persistence, security, and company-based access control using Supabase.

### Database Implementation
- **Current Implementation: Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
  - A Backend-as-a-Service platform providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage.
  - Integrated via the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library.
  - Leverages Repository Pattern for data access abstraction.

### Table Structure (Supabase Schema)
- **Tables:**
  - **`companies`**: Stores organization data (`id`, `name`, `admin_ids`, `created_at`, `settings`).
  - **`users`**: Manages user profiles (`id`, `firebase_uid` (legacy/optional), `company_id`, `email`, `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `status`, `preferences`, `role`, `last_active`).
  - **`spaces`**: Tracks virtual spaces/rooms (`id`, `company_id`, `name`, `type`, `status`, `capacity`, `features`, `position`, `user_ids`, `description`, `access_control`, `created_by`, `is_template`).
  - **`space_reservations`**: Manages booking of spaces (`id`, `space_id`, `user_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `purpose`).
  - **`conversations`**: Represents chat threads (`id`, `type`, `participants`, `last_activity`, `name`, `is_archived`, `unread_count`, `room_id`).
  - **`messages`**: Stores chat messages (`id`, `conversation_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `timestamp`, `type`, `status`, `reply_to_id`, `is_edited`).
  - **`message_attachments`**: Stores message file attachments (`id`, `message_id`, `name`, `type`, `size`, `url`).
  - **`message_reactions`**: Tracks reactions to messages (`id`, `message_id`, `user_id`, `emoji`).
  - **`announcements`**: Holds company-wide posts (`id`, `company_id`, `title`, `content`, `posted_by`, `timestamp`, `expiration`, `priority`).
  - **`meeting_notes`**: Archives meeting details (`id`, `room_id`, `title`, `meeting_date`, `transcript`, `summary`, `generated_by`, `edited_by`).
  - **`meeting_note_action_items`**: Tracks tasks from meetings (`id`, `note_id`, `description`, `assignee_id`, `due_date`, `completed`).
  - **`invitations`**: Manages user invitations to companies (`token`, `email`, `company_id`, `role`, `expires_at`, `status`).
  - **`space_members`**: Manages explicit space membership (`id`, `space_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `joined_at`).
  - **`space_presence_log`**: Tracks space entry/exit for analytics (`id`, `space_id`, `user_id`, `entered_at`, `exited_at`, `session_type`, `context`).

### Security and Access Control
- **Space-Level Access Control**
  - Explicit membership tracking via `space_members` table
  - Role-based permissions (member, admin, director)
  - "Knock to Enter" workflow for restricted spaces
  - Cross-space calling capability
  
- **Message Visibility**
  - Public messages visible to all space members
  - Private messages for specific participants
  - Direct messages between two users
  
- **Supabase RLS Policies**
  - Fine-grained access control at row level
  - Automatic filtering based on user roles and space membership
  - Secure message visibility enforcement

- **Supabase Authentication** for user login and session management.
- **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for fine-grained data access control.
- **Repository Pattern** enforces data access rules within the application logic.
- API routes protected via middleware and session checks.

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Presence Tracking**
  - Detailed entry/exit logging
  - Session duration analysis
  - Interaction patterns
  - Meeting analytics

## Project Structure & Import Patterns
- Follow the `src/` layout: `app/`, `components/`, `contexts/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `repositories/`, `types/`, `utils/`.
- Co-locate related components and keep one component per file.
- Use the `@/` alias for internal imports.
- Group imports: external → internal (`@/`) → relative.
