# Interactive Floor Plan Completion Instructions

## Objective
Implement dynamic interaction features for the floor plan to enhance user experience, including drag-and-drop functionality, zooming capabilities, and detailed room information popups.

## Context
The floor plan is a central component of the virtual office application, allowing users to navigate and interact with the virtual workspace. Currently, basic floor plan functionality exists in the following files:
- `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanCanvas.tsx`: Main canvas component for rendering the floor plan
- `src/components/floor-plan/floor-plan.tsx`: Container component for the floor plan
- `src/components/floor-plan/room-dialog.tsx`: Dialog for room creation and editing
- `src/components/floor-plan/types.ts`: TypeScript definitions for floor plan components
- `src/app/(dashboard)/floor-plan/layout.tsx`: Layout for the floor plan page
- `src/app/(dashboard)/floor-plan/page.tsx`: Page component for the floor plan

The floor plan needs enhanced interactivity to provide a more engaging and intuitive user experience.

## Dependencies
- 2Ab: `src/components` (floor-plan components depend on this module)
- 2Ad: `src/contexts` (floor plan may need context for state management)
- 2Af: `src/lib` (utility functions may be needed for floor plan interactions)

## Steps
1. **Enhance Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
   - Implement smooth dragging of room elements within the floor plan
   - Add snap-to-grid functionality for precise placement
   - Enable resizing of rooms through drag handles
   - Implement collision detection to prevent room overlap

2. **Add Zooming and Panning Capabilities**
   - Implement zoom in/out functionality with mouse wheel and touch gestures
   - Add zoom controls (buttons for zoom in/out and reset)
   - Implement panning/scrolling to navigate larger floor plans
   - Ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes

3. **Create Detailed Room Information Popups**
   - Design and implement popups that display when hovering/clicking on rooms
   - Show room details (name, capacity, current occupants)
   - Add quick action buttons in popups (join, message, etc.)
   - Ensure popups are accessible and responsive

4. **Implement User Interaction Feedback**
   - Add visual feedback for interactions (hover states, selection indicators)
   - Implement animations for transitions (room creation, movement)
   - Add sound effects for key interactions (optional)
   - Ensure all interactions have appropriate accessibility features

5. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement efficient rendering techniques for the canvas
   - Use React.memo or useMemo for optimized component rendering
   - Implement virtualization for large floor plans
   - Add performance monitoring and optimization

## Expected Output
- Enhanced FloorPlanCanvas component with drag-and-drop, zooming, and popup functionality
- Updated floor-plan component with new interactive features
- Improved user experience with responsive and intuitive interactions
- Optimized performance for smooth operation even with complex floor plans

## Notes
- Consider using a library like react-draggable or react-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality
- Zoom functionality might benefit from a library like use-gesture or react-zoom-pan-pinch
- Ensure all new features work well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Maintain accessibility standards throughout implementation
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
